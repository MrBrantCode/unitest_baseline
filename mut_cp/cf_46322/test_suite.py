from solution import count_up_to
This function aims to generate a list of prime numbers up to but not including the given number `n`, and includes a validation mechanism to ensure the correctness of the prime generation algorithm. The validation uses a helper function `is_prime` to verify each prime number generated by the main loop. The function also measures the time taken to execute the prime generation process.
