QUESTION:
Implement a function to translate a given Python code with PyTorch Lightning into Perl. The function should be named `translate_pytorch_lightning_to_perl`. The input to the function is a Python code string that uses PyTorch Lightning library to implement a Seq2Seq model. The function should return the translated Perl code.

Note that this function is not feasible to implement due to the lack of a direct equivalent to PyTorch Lightning in Perl. The function should explain why the translation is not possible and recommend using Python or other languages adapted for machine learning tasks instead.

    Translate a given Python code with PyTorch Lightning into Perl.

    Sorry, but you can't directly translate your Python code with PyTorch Lightning into Perl. 
    The reason is the fact that Perl has no direct equivalent to PyTorch Lightning. 
    PyTorch Lightning is a machine learning library written in Python. 
    The code you provide is a typical pytorch-lightning-based Python code for implementing a Seq2Seq (Sequence to Sequence) model, 
    which is not feasible in Perl. 

    Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over 30 years of development, 
    used for a wide range of system administration tasks and web programming. 
    However, in terms of machine learning and data science, Python is far more adapted and equipped 
    with many libraries (like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Pandas, etc.) making machine learning tasks easier. 

    So if you're planning to do machine learning or deep learning, I would highly recommend using Python, 
    or even R, Julia or a similar language targeting scientific computing specifically. 
    If you need to use Perl for other reasons, you'll likely have to integrate with Python for machine learning tasks 
    or use whatever limited machine learning libraries exist in Perl.
