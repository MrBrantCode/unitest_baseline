QUESTION:
Create a function named `sphere_volume` that calculates the volume of a sphere given its radius as input. The function should take one argument `radius` and return the volume. Use the formula (4/3) * Pi * radius^3 for calculation, where Pi is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.
