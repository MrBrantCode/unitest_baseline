QUESTION:
Write a function `number_of_functions(m, n)` to calculate the number of non-identical functions that can potentially map a set 'A' of m unique elements into a set 'B' of n unique elements. The function should take two parameters, m and n, where m and n are the sizes of sets 'A' and 'B' respectively.
