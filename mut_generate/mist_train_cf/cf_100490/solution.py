QUESTION:
Write a Python function `second_derivative(x)` that calculates the second derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x - 3 and returns its value. The function should not take any other parameters besides x. Assume the input x is a numeric value within the interval [-5,5]. The function should return a numeric value representing the second derivative of f(x) at x.
