QUESTION:
Implement a recursive Merge Sort algorithm to sort an unsorted array of numbers in ascending order. The function should be named merge_sort and should not use any comparison-based sorting algorithm, built-in sorting functions, or libraries. The function should also not use extra space for merging the arrays, have a time complexity of O(n log n), and be able to handle arrays with duplicate elements and very large input arrays efficiently.
