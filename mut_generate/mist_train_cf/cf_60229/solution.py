QUESTION:
Write a function `race_distance` that calculates the distance of the tortoise from the finish line when the hare completes the race. The function takes two parameters: `hare_time` and `tortoise_time`, which represent the time it takes for the hare and tortoise to complete the race respectively. The function should return the fraction of the race course that the tortoise is away from the finish line when the hare completes the race.
