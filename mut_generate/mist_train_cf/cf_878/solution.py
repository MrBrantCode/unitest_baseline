QUESTION:
Write a function `calculate_time_complexity(n)` that calculates the time complexity of a given code snippet with four nested loops, where each loop iterates from its starting index to n. The function should return the time complexity in Big O notation.

Note: The loops are nested such that the starting index of each loop is the current index of the previous loop.
