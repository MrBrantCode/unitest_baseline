QUESTION:
Design a digital platform that is accessible and user-friendly for visually impaired individuals.

Considerations should include the potential implications of emerging technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Artificial Intelligence (AI), as well as the challenges of designing a one-size-fits-all solution.
