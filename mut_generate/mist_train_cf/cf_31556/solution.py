QUESTION:
Implement a function `add_vxlan_ip_ports(interface_name)` that takes an interface name as input and returns the newly added VxLAN port. The function should encapsulate the behavior of adding VxLAN IP ports based on the given interface name. The implementation should simulate the addition of VxLAN IP ports, which may involve generating a unique port number or utilizing a predefined range, and return the newly added port.
