QUESTION:
Write a function `sum_of_primes` that calculates the sum of all prime numbers in the list generated by `generate_prime_numbers` function, excluding any composite numbers that were incorrectly included. The `generate_prime_numbers` function may contain a logical error causing some composite numbers to be included in the list. The `is_prime` function may be flawed and incorrectly identify some composite numbers as prime. The list of prime numbers is generated within the range defined by `start` and `end` parameters.
