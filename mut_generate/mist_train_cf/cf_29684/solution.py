QUESTION:
Implement a class `TestArticleRecommender` with an initializer that loads a corpus for testing. The initializer should also set the `knn_dimension` attribute by calling a method named `knn_prediction`. The `knn_prediction` method should take a 5x10 zero-filled 2D numpy array and a list containing a zero-filled 10-element 1D numpy array as input, and return the KNN prediction.
