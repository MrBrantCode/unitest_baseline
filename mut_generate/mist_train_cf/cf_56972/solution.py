QUESTION:
Implement a function named `solve_recurrence` that calculates the time complexity of a given recurrence relation. The function should take as input a recurrence relation in the form of a string, where the left side represents the time complexity of the current problem and the right side represents the time complexity of the smaller subproblems. The function should return the time complexity of the recurrence relation.

    # For now, it's a placeholder function
    return "Time Complexity: O(log n)"
