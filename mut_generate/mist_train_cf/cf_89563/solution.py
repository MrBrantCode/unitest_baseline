QUESTION:
Implement a function named `merge_sort` that takes an array of integers as input and returns the sorted array in ascending order. The function should use a custom sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(nlogn) or better, without using any built-in sorting functions or libraries, and without creating any extra arrays or data structures during the sorting process. The function should be able to handle arrays with duplicate elements.
