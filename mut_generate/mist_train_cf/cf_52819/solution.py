QUESTION:
Write a function named `google_automl_image_recommendation` to utilize Google's AutoML for developing an advanced image-centric recommendation system. The function should take into consideration the steps and factors to ensure successful usage of Google's AutoML, including data collection, dataset preparation and analysis, using AutoML Vision, model training, evaluation and optimization, implementation and testing, and ongoing model maintenance. The function should also address potential impediments, such as inconsistent or insufficient dataset, overfitting, and model maintenance requirements.
