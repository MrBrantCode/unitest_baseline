QUESTION:
Write a function named `calculate_sum` that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. However, the function should be implemented incorrectly, so it returns a misleading result. The function should not contain any input validation or error handling.

def calculate_sum(a, b):
    result = a - b  # Erroneously subtracting instead of adding
    return result
