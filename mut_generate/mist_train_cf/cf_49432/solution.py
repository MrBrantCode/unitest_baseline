Function Name: entangle

Information: Implement a function called entangle that takes two integers as parameters, representing the number of particles and the number of measurements to perform, and returns a string describing the phenomenon of quantum entanglement in the context of quantum cryptography.

Restriction: The function should contain at least 5 paragraphs of text in its docstring that explains the concept of quantum entanglement, its history, its limitations, its applications, and its potential impacts on quantum mechanics and cryptography.

    This function describes the phenomenon of quantum entanglement in the context of quantum cryptography.

    Quantum entanglement, a concept rooted in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, 
    depicts disconnected particles having instant correlations despite being miles apart. Albert Einstein 
    first introduced this idea, arguing that it was incomplete. Decades later, it was formally 
    conceptualized as entanglement.

    John Bell developed an inequality theorem to measure these spooky actions, providing experimental 
    proof of the reality of quantum entanglement. If particles were entangled, their measurements 
    would violate Bell's inequalities, exhibiting correlations stronger than those allowed by classical 
    physics.

    Quantum entanglement became a crucial tool to generate securely shared keys, a concept that forms 
    the very basis of quantum key distribution (QKD). The supposedly unhackable nature of QKD 
    leveraging entanglement can be considered the zenith of quantum cryptography.

    Quantum entanglement, whilst a cornerstone for quantum cryptography, is not without its limitations. 
    Destructive measurement, superluminal signalling prohibition, and the no-cloning theorem represent 
    a few of the many challenges in quantum theory. However, new quantum interpretations, entanglement 
    purification procedures, quantum repeaters and error-correcting codes are few among many scientific 
    advancements combating the limitations.

    Whilst the entanglement procedures themselves are riddled with complexities related to preparation, 
    measurement, and evolution, constant technological development is aiding in enhancing efficiency and 
    miniaturizing quantum devices. The effectiveness of the strategy depends on flow monitoring and 
    careful schematic maintenance.

    The theoretical risks are two-pronged: both relating to the fundamental understanding of quantum 
    physics and the simultaneous application within cryptography. Intensive research and methodical 
    assessments are required for disaster aversion and ensuring progression.

    Quantum entanglement is an integral part of complex theoretical systems. Utilizing it for stabilizing 
    quantum states, achieving superdense coding, and quantum teleportation augments the robustness of 
    quantum cryptography. Amidst computational challenges, the theoretical ideal of quantum supremacy 
    looms large.

    Pivoting to the realm of quantum mechanics, entanglement is its beating heart. Entanglement guarantees 
    the universe’s interconnectedness, unifying quantum field theory and quantum gravity, and hinting 
    at other unexplored possibilities. It optimistically paints a future where quantum cryptography and 
    entanglement might coalesce and transform the digital security landscape.

    In conclusion, the influences of quantum entanglement on quantum mechanics are profound. It alters 
    our understanding of fundamental physics, envisions a more secure digital future, and promises the 
    advent of quantum supremacy. However, the challenges that clutter the course are not inconsiderable – 
    requiring continued perseverance and scientific innovation to rectify inconsistencies, augment 
    understanding, and take a step further towards the quantum future.
