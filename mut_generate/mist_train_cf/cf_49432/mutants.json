      "code": "def entangle(particles, measurements):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function describes the phenomenon of quantum entanglement in the context of quantum cryptography.\n\n    Quantum entanglement, a concept rooted in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, \n    depicts disconnected particles having instant correlations despite being miles apart. Albert Einstein \n    first introduced this idea, arguing that it was incomplete. Decades later, it was formally \n    conceptualized as entanglement.\n\n    John Bell developed an inequality theorem to measure these spooky actions, providing experimental \n    proof of the reality of quantum entanglement. If particles were entangled, their measurements \n    would violate Bell's inequalities, exhibiting correlations stronger than those allowed by classical \n    physics.\n\n    Quantum entanglement became a crucial tool to generate securely shared keys, a concept that forms \n    the very basis of quantum key distribution (QKD). The supposedly unhackable nature of QKD \n    leveraging entanglement can be considered the zenith of quantum cryptography.\n\n    Quantum entanglement, whilst a cornerstone for quantum cryptography, is not without its limitations. \n    Destructive measurement, superluminal signalling prohibition, and the no-cloning theorem represent \n    a few of the many challenges in quantum theory. However, new quantum interpretations, entanglement \n    purification procedures, quantum repeaters and error-correcting codes are few among many scientific \n    advancements combating the limitations.\n\n    Whilst the entanglement procedures themselves are riddled with complexities related to preparation, \n    measurement, and evolution, constant technological development is aiding in enhancing efficiency and \n    miniaturizing quantum devices. The effectiveness of the strategy depends on flow monitoring and \n    careful schematic maintenance.\n\n    The theoretical risks are two-pronged: both relating to the fundamental understanding of quantum \n    physics and the simultaneous application within cryptography. Intensive research and methodical \n    assessments are required for disaster aversion and ensuring progression.\n\n    Quantum entanglement is an integral part of complex theoretical systems. Utilizing it for stabilizing \n    quantum states, achieving superdense coding, and quantum teleportation augments the robustness of \n    quantum cryptography. Amidst computational challenges, the theoretical ideal of quantum supremacy \n    looms large.\n\n    Pivoting to the realm of quantum mechanics, entanglement is its beating heart. Entanglement guarantees \n    the universe’s interconnectedness, unifying quantum field theory and quantum gravity, and hinting \n    at other unexplored possibilities. It optimistically paints a future where quantum cryptography and \n    entanglement might coalesce and transform the digital security landscape.\n\n    In conclusion, the influences of quantum entanglement on quantum mechanics are profound. It alters \n    our understanding of fundamental physics, envisions a more secure digital future, and promises the \n    advent of quantum supremacy. However, the challenges that clutter the course are not inconsiderable – \n    requiring continued perseverance and scientific innovation to rectify inconsistencies, augment \n    understanding, and take a step further towards the quantum future.\n\n    Parameters:\n    particles (int): The number of particles.\n    measurements (int): The number of measurements to perform.\n\n    Returns:\n    str: A string describing the phenomenon of quantum entanglement in the context of quantum cryptography.\n    \"\"\"\n    return ''"
