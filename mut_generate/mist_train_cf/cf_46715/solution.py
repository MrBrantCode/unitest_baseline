QUESTION:
Determine the value of `minimize_expression` function that takes three parameters x, y, and z. The function should return the value of f that minimizes (4x - 3y)^3, given the equation (4x - 3y)^3 = z + f. 

The function should consider boundary conditions and should be effective for larger numbers. However, please note that additional conditions or relationships between x, y, z, and f are required to provide a meaningful solution.
"""

def minimize_expression(x, y, z):
    """
    The function minimizes (4x - 3y)^3 by considering boundary conditions and large numbers.

    Parameters:
    x (float): The first variable in the equation.
    y (float): The second variable in the equation.
    z (float): The third variable in the equation.

    Returns:
    float: The value of f that minimizes (4x - 3y)^3 given the equation (4x - 3y)^3 = z + f.

    Note: The function cannot be completed without additional conditions or relationships between x, y, z, and f.
