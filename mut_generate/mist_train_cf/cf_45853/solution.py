QUESTION:
Create a function `add_van_gogh_style` that takes an SVG path as input and applies a 'Starry Night' texture to it, mimicking the style of Vincent van Gogh's painting. The function should return the modified SVG path. Note that this task is not feasible with SVG alone, as it does not support texture or style manipulation. However, the function should provide an alternative solution, such as recommending the use of raster image editors or AI-powered style transfer models to achieve the desired effect.
