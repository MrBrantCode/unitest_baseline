QUESTION:
Apply a Complex Mathematical Formula to a List of Integers using map()

Create a function that takes a list of integers as input, applies a complex mathematical formula (num ** 2 + 2 * num + 1) to each element, and returns a new list containing the results. Use the map() function in Python to implement this.

Restrictions: 
- The function must use the map() function.
- The function must take a list of integers as input.
- The function must apply the complex mathematical formula (num ** 2 + 2 * num + 1) to each element in the list.
- The function must return a new list containing the results.
