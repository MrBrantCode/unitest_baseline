QUESTION:
Design a function `perform_search` that takes a text query and returns the relevant results in an arranged format. The function should be able to handle a large number of queries efficiently, with a focus on high-performance and scalability.

def perform_search(query):
    # This is a placeholder for the actual search implementation
    # In a real-world application, this would likely involve interacting with a database or search index
    # For demonstration purposes, it simply returns a dummy result

                        {"title": "Result 2", "description": "This is the second result"}]}
