QUESTION:
Implement the function `merge_sort(arr)` that takes an array of integers as input and returns the sorted array in ascending order. The function must have a time complexity of O(n log n) and cannot use any built-in sorting functions or methods. The array can contain both positive and negative integers, and the function should handle duplicate elements efficiently.
