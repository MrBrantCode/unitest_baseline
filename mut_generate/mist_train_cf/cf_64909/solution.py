QUESTION:
Implement a function named `quantum_superposition` that takes in a list of binary states and returns the superposed state as a binary string. The function should handle states with any number of bits and should not contain any irrelevant information or code snippets. The function should be able to represent the superposed state where all possible states exist simultaneously.
