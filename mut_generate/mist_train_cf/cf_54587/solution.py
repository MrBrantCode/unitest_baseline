QUESTION:
Implement a function named 'quantum_machine_learning' that leverages the principles of Quantum Superposition and Quantum Tunneling to improve the speed and precision of complex machine learning algorithms, especially for large-scale, multi-dimensional data structures. The function should be able to integrate these principles into a stratified logical reasoning process to ensure superior outcomes while maintaining the originality of the primary data.
