QUESTION:
Implement a function named `process` that takes two inputs: a list of strings `puzzle_input` and a boolean `verbose` flag. The function should return two values: `p1` and `p2`, representing the results of processing the puzzle input. Implement the logic to calculate `p1` and `p2` based on the provided puzzle input. The function should handle the input according to the problem's requirements and return the results for part one and part two of the puzzle.

def process(puzzle_input, verbose=False):
    # Implement the processing logic for the puzzle input
    # Calculate p1 and p2 based on the processed input
    p1 = 0  # Placeholder for part one result
    p2 = 0  # Placeholder for part two result

    # Your processing logic for part one and part two goes here

    return p1, p2
