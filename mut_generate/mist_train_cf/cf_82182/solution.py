QUESTION:
Write a function `func(n)` to calculate the sum of all iterations of a nested loop that runs `n` times. The function should take an integer `n` as input and return the total count of iterations. Optimize the function to achieve the best possible time complexity. The function should only take an integer `n` as input and should not use any additional data structures.
