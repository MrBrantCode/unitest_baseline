QUESTION:
Create a function called `modify_router_firmware` that customizes router firmware for MediaTek MTK7526G/MTK7525 chipsets. The function should uncompact and recompact the firmware to work with the chipset format. Note that MediaTek does not publicly distribute the SDK for their MTK7526G/MTK7525 chipsets, so the solution should not rely on using the official SDK.
