QUESTION:
Implement a function `view_assembly(assembly, surface)` that takes a collection of 3D objects (`assembly`) and a view surface (`surface`) as input, and returns a 2D representation of the assembly as viewed from the specified surface. The view representation should accurately depict the relative positions and orientations of the objects in the assembly as seen from the given surface. The function should return a string representing the 2D view.
"""

def view_assembly(assembly, surface) -> str:
    # Simulate the 3D rendering and visualization process to generate the view representation
    # Code to project the 3D assembly onto the specified surface and generate a 2D representation
    # Return the 2D representation as a string
    return "2D representation of the assembly as viewed from the specified surface"
