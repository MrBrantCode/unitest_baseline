QUESTION:
You are to create a function called `quantum_teleportation`. The function should accept two parameters: a teleported state (an integer representing the state of a quantum particle) and a distance (an integer representing the distance the particle needs to be teleported). The function should simulate the teleportation process, taking into account the principles of quantum mechanics and quantum entanglement.
"""

def quantum_teleportation(teleported_state, distance):
    """
    Simulates the teleportation process of a quantum particle.

    Args:
        teleported_state (int): The state of the quantum particle.
        distance (int): The distance the particle needs to be teleported.

    Returns:
        int: The final state of the quantum particle after teleportation.
    """
    # Since the actual implementation of quantum teleportation is a complex process 
    # that involves quantum entanglement and other principles of quantum mechanics, 
    # this function will simply return the teleported state as is.
