QUESTION:
Implement a function named concatenate_strings that takes two strings as input and returns their concatenated result. The function should achieve this without using any built-in string concatenation methods, such as the + operator or the join() function. The time complexity of the function must be O(1), meaning the execution time should not be affected by the lengths of the input strings.
