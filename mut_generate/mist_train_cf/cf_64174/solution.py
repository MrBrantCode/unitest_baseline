QUESTION:
Design a function called `quantum_layered_learning` that leverages the principles of Quantum Entanglement and Quantum Decoherence to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of advanced machine learning algorithms when dealing with vast, complex data sets. The function should take into account the constantly evolving nature of data and the increasing intricacy of machine learning models.
