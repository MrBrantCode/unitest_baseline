    Quantum superposition lies at the heart of quantum mechanics, the physical framework compelling the world's most innovative pioneering science, quantum computing. 
    Quantum superposition maintains that a quantum system can exist in multiple states or configurations simultaneously. 
    The potential of a quantum-based system being in multiple states at once is critical to the merits and efficacy of quantum computing.

    Since its inception, the principles underlying quantum superposition have been pivots of modern physics, tracing back to the early explorations of quantum mechanics by geniuses like Planck and Einstein. 
    However, it was Schrödinger's Cat thought experiment that brought the concept of superposition to the limelight, fundamentally challenging our long-established understanding of classical science and the ontological hypotheses of reality.

    In the realm of quantum computing, superposition lies at the crux of the computation power. 
    Unlike classical bits that can exist only in one state—either 0 or 1—at any given time, a quantum bit, or qubit, thanks to superposition, can exist in a state that is simultaneously 0 and 1. 
    The power of quantum computing lies in this property of qubits, allowing computation on many inputs at the same time, vastly augmenting speed and processing capabilities.

    The exploitation of this principle is not without challenges, though. 
    Quantum superposition is a fragile state—interactions with external environments can instantaneously collapse superposed states, leading to decoherence, the primary limitation and challenge in maintaining quantum computing systems. 
    To counteract this, strategies like quantum error correction, quantum shielding, and topological quantum computing are being designed and employed to preserve and stick with the superposition of qubits.

    Another hurdle to surmount is the accurate measurement of states within the superposition. 
    Superposed states can only be known probabilistically, not definitively - an inherent limitation in prediction potential. 
    Techniques like quantum state tomography and direct quantum process tomography, though, have given us tools to make such predictions with improved accuracy.

    From a grand perspective, quantum computing is the new frontier in theoretical systems, with quantum superposition as its lodestar. 
    In today's superseding world of technology, it can enable hyper-efficient simulations, complex optimization problems, and lead to exponential speedups in data encryption and decryption.

    Yet, as promising and powerful as quantum superposition is, it marks only the start of speculative frameworks in quantum mechanics. 
    Other subdomains like entanglement, quantum tunneling, and quantum teleportation present a broader, untapped vista of quantum mechanics. 
    With ongoing research, we can expect quantum superposition to continue to shape and influence this field's future direction.

    In conclusion, the journey of quantum superposition from abstract fundamentals to the lifeblood of quantum computing has been a testament to human ingenuity. 
    Yes, it has its limitations and complexities, but with each passing day, we are learning to circumnavigate these challenges, navigating forward into a new era of computational progress. 
    With such an evolutionary endpoint, quantum superposition is heralding a new era in information science where quantum computing will take center stage.
