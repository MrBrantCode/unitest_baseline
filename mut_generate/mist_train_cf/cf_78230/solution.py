QUESTION:
Write a function `euclidean_distance(point1, point2)` that calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in n-dimensional space. The input points are represented as tuples or lists of numbers. Ensure the function checks for and handles cases where the input tuples or lists have different lengths, returning an error message in such cases.
