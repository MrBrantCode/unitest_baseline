QUESTION:
Implement the `say_text` function, which takes a string of text and a host as input, simulates the text-to-speech process, and returns the time taken to say the text. The function should also print the text and the time taken to say the text. Note that you should replace the simulated time with actual text-to-speech implementation using the specified host.

import time

def say_text(host, text):
    # Simulate the text-to-speech process
    # Here, you can implement the actual text-to-speech functionality using the specified host
    # For the purpose of this problem, we will simulate the process by returning a random time
    # Replace this with actual text-to-speech implementation using the specified host
    time_taken = 2  # Simulated time to say the text
    print(text, 'time:', time_taken)
    return time_taken
