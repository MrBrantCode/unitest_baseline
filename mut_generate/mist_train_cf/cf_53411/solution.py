QUESTION:
Implement a function called 'quantum_framework' to calculate the total complexity of a quantum-nano framework. The complexity is calculated based on the sum of complexities added by the following factors: quantum computing, nanotechnology, system failures, future expansion, quantum-nano security threats, ethical implications, societal influence, economic consequences, environmental sustainability, health effects, legislation and policy changes, and future-proofing.
