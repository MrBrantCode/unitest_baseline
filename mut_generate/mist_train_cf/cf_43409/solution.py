QUESTION:
Implement a function `quantum_entanglement` that calculates and returns the quantum entanglement between two particles. The function should take two parameters: `particle1` and `particle2`, which represent the states of the two particles. The function should return a value representing the degree of entanglement between the two particles.
"""

def quantum_entanglement(particle1, particle2):
    # Calculate the degree of entanglement between the two particles
    # The actual implementation would depend on the specific quantum mechanics formulas
    # For the sake of simplicity, let's assume it's the absolute difference between the two particles
    return abs(particle1 - particle2)
