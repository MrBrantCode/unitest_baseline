"""
QUESTION:
Write a function called `quantum_ai_enhancer` that integrates the principles of Quantum Superposition and Quantum Tunneling into a stratified learning architecture for artificial intelligence. The function should take in a complex dataset as input and return a superior result, while also enabling multi-tiered learning and decision-making procedures and preserving the authenticity of the original data.
