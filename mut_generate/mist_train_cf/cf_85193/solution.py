QUESTION:
Create a function `add` that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. Implement a mutation testing system that applies different mutation operators (such as changing arithmetic operations) to the `add` function. Evaluate the effectiveness of the mutation testing system by writing unit tests for the original and mutated `add` functions.
