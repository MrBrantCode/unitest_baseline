QUESTION:
Design a function named `apply_quantum_principles` that leverages the principles of Quantum Superposition and Quantum Tunneling to improve the efficiency and precision of machine learning algorithms when dealing with massive, multi-dimensional data sets. The function should be able to integrate these principles into a hierarchical decision-making structure to attain the most optimal outcomes while maintaining the integrity of the original data. The function should also be adaptable to the rapid progression of data and the increasing complexity of machine learning models.
