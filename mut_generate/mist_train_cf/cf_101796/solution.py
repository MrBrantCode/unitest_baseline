QUESTION:
Create a function `calculate_area(length, width)` that calculates the area of a rectangle, and write a test suite that achieves a minimum code coverage of 90% for this function. The function should take two parameters, `length` and `width`, and return the area of the rectangle. The test suite should be able to detect any mutations in the function that result in incorrect calculations.
