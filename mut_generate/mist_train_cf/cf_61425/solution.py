QUESTION:
Design a function named `quantum_entanglement` that takes a complex quantum system as input, and returns a structured analytical framework to overcome the obstacles of quantum entanglement, including its practical application, theoretical inconsistencies, and potential risks in quantum computing. The function should focus on the role of quantum entanglement in quantum computing, including its origin, progression, and impact on quantum computing performance. The function should also consider the intricacies of quantum superposition and entanglement, and provide strategies for identifying and rectifying theoretical inconsistencies, while ensuring the continuous progress and widespread adoption of quantum entanglement theories.
