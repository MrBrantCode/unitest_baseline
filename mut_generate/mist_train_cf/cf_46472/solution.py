QUESTION:
Write a function `fractional_knapsack` that takes three inputs: a list of item values, a list of corresponding item weights, and the maximum capacity of the knapsack. The function should return the maximum total value that can be achieved and the fraction of each item to include in the knapsack, subject to the constraint that the total weight does not exceed the capacity. Assume that items can be taken in fractional amounts.
