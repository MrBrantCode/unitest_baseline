QUESTION:
Write a function `provideCodeSuggestions` that takes in a string `code` representing the code being written and returns a list of relevant code snippets that can be used to enhance the existing code. The function should analyze the code in real-time and suggest code snippets based on the user's context, including alternative implementations for commonly used functions or methods. The function should adhere to the coding style and best practices of the specific language and optimize the time complexity of indexing and analyzing the code for efficient performance.
