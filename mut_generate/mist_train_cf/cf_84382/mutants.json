However, it doesn't account for the recall (the ability of a model to find all relevant instances in the dataset), meaning it doesn't matter if some n-grams in the reference text weren't found in the generated text.\\nAlternatively, the ROUGE metric emphasizes recall over precision. It measures how many n-grams in the reference text appear in the generated text. In addition, various types of ROUGE scores exist such as ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L, and ROUGE-S, where N focuses on n-gram stats, L considers longest matching sequence, and S considers skip-bigram which captures the sentence level structure similarity naturally.\\nTherefore, while BLEU checks how many parts of machine translations appear in at least one of the references, ROUGE checks how much of the reference appears in the machine translations. They reflect different aspects of translation quality and might be chosen depending on specific tasks.\"\n    return description"
