QUESTION:
Implement the `merge_sort` function to sort a given list of numbers in descending order. The function should have a time complexity of O(n log n) and a space complexity of O(log n), and it should be stable, maintaining the relative order of elements with equal values during the sorting process. Do not use any built-in sorting functions or libraries.
