QUESTION:
Create a class with the following functions: `add(a, b)`, `subtract(a, b)`, and one additional method of your choice. The `add(a, b)` function should return the sum of `a` and `b`, and the `subtract(a, b)` function should return the difference between `a` and `b`. All functions should take two arguments, `a` and `b`, which will be numbers.

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b
