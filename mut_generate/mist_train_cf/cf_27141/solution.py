QUESTION:
Create a function `calculate_cross_section(mass)` that takes the mass of the Z' particle in GeV as input and returns the corresponding cross section for the semihadronic, semileptonic process pp -> ttbar Z', Z' -> bbbar. The cross section should be calculated within the function using appropriate methods or models. The function should take into account the provided masses for which signal samples were created.
