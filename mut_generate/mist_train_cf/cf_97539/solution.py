QUESTION:
Write a Python function `calculate_area(length, width)` that calculates the area of a rectangle. Implement mutation testing using `mutmut` and `pytest` to ensure that the test suite achieves a minimum code coverage of 90%. The function should take two parameters, `length` and `width`, and return their product.
