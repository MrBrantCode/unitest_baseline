QUESTION:
Implement a function `polynomial` that calculates the result of a polynomial equation of degree 4 with coefficients a, b, c, d, and e. The function should take one argument `x` and return the result of the equation ax⁴ + bx³ + cx² + dx + e. Assume the coefficients a, b, c, d, and e are given.
