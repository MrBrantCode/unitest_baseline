QUESTION:
Write a function called "permute" that takes an input string of alphanumeric characters and returns the reversed string. Implement a comprehensive unit testing suite to verify the correctness of the "permute" function. The testing suite should cover a variety of cases, including but not limited to: strings with a mix of letters and numbers, empty strings, and strings with a single character.
