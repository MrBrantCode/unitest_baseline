QUESTION:
Timur initially had a binary string$^{\dagger}$ $s$ (possibly of length $0$). He performed the following operation several (possibly zero) times:

Add ${0}$ to one end of the string and ${1}$ to the other end of the string. For example, starting from the string ${1011}$, you can obtain either ${{0}}{1011}{{1}}$ or ${{1}}{1011}{{0}}$.

You are given Timur's final string. What is the length of the shortest possible string he could have started with?

$^{\dagger}$ A binary string is a string (possibly the empty string) whose characters are either ${0}$ or ${1}$.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains an integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$) — the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 2000$) — the length of Timur's final string.

The second line of each test case contains a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of characters ${0}$ or ${1}$, denoting the final string.


-----Output-----

For each test case, output a single nonnegative integer — the shortest possible length of Timur's original string. Note that Timur's original string could have been empty, in which case you should output $0$.

-----Note-----

In the first test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is ${0}$, and he performed the following operation: ${0} \to {{1}}{0}{{0}}$.

In the second test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is ${11}$, and he performed the following operation: ${11} \to {{0}}{11}{{1}}$.

In the third test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is ${10101}$, and he didn't perform any operations.

In the fourth test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is the empty string (which we denote by $\varepsilon$), and he performed the following operations: $\varepsilon \to {{1}}{}{{0}} \to {{0}}{10}{{1}} \to {{1}}{0101}{{0}}$.

In the fifth test case, the shortest possible string Timur started with is ${101}$, and he performed the following operations: ${101} \to {{0}}{101}{{1}} \to {{1}}{01011}{{0}}$.
