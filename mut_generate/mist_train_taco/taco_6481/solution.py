QUESTION:
Given a string s consisting only lower case alphabets, find the minimum number of changes required to it so that all substrings of the string become distinct.
Note: length of the string is at most 26.
Example 1:
Input: S = "aab"
Output: 1
Explanation: If we change one instance 
of 'a' to any character from 'c' to 'z', 
we get all distinct substrings.
Ã¢â¬â¹Example 2:
Input: S = "ab"
Output: 0
Explanation: As no change is required
hence 0.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minChange() which takes the string S as inputs and returns the answer.
Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(26)
Constraints:
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 26
