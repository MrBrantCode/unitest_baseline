QUESTION:
You have a computer literacy course in your university. In the computer system, the login/logout records of all PCs in a day are stored in a file. Although students may use two or more PCs at a time, no one can log in to a PC which has been logged in by someone who has not logged out of that PC yet.

You are asked to write a program that calculates the total time of a student that he/she used at least one PC in a given time period (probably in a laboratory class) based on the records in the file.

The following are example login/logout records.

* The student 1 logged in to the PC 1 at 12:55
* The student 2 logged in to the PC 4 at 13:00
* The student 1 logged in to the PC 2 at 13:10
* The student 1 logged out of the PC 2 at 13:20
* The student 1 logged in to the PC 3 at 13:30
* The student 1 logged out of the PC 1 at 13:40
* The student 1 logged out of the PC 3 at 13:45
* The student 1 logged in to the PC 1 at 14:20
* The student 2 logged out of the PC 4 at 14:30
* The student 1 logged out of the PC 1 at 14:40


For a query such as "Give usage of the student 1 between 13:00 and 14:30", your program should answer "55 minutes", that is, the sum of 45 minutes from 13:00 to 13:45 and 10 minutes from 14:20 to 14:30, as depicted in the following figure.

Input

The input is a sequence of a number of datasets. The end of the input is indicated by a line containing two zeros separated by a space. The number of datasets never exceeds 10.

Each dataset is formatted as follows.

> N M
>  r
>  record1
>  ...
>  recordr
>  q
>  query1
>  ...
>  queryq
>

The numbers N  and M  in the first line are the numbers of PCs and the students, respectively. r  is the number of records. q  is the number of queries. These four are integers satisfying the following.

> 1 ≤ N  ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ M  ≤ 10000, 2 ≤ r  ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ q  ≤ 50

Each record consists of four integers, delimited by a space, as follows.

> t  n  m  s

s  is 0 or 1. If s  is 1, this line means that the student m  logged in to the PC n  at time t . If s  is 0, it means that the student m  logged out of the PC n  at time t . The time is expressed as elapsed minutes from 0:00 of the day. t , n  and m  satisfy the following.

> 540 ≤ t  ≤ 1260, 1 ≤ n  ≤ N , 1 ≤ m  ≤ M

You may assume the following about the records.
* Records are stored in ascending order of time t.
* No two records for the same PC has the same time t.
* No PCs are being logged in before the time of the first record nor after that of the last record in the file.
* Login and logout records for one PC appear alternatingly, and each of the login-logout record pairs is for the same student.

Each query consists of three integers delimited by a space, as follows.

> ts  te  m

It represents "Usage of the student m  between ts  and te ". ts , te  and m  satisfy the following.

> 540 ≤ ts  < te  ≤ 1260, 1 ≤ m  ≤ M

Output

For each query, print a line having a decimal integer indicating the time of usage in minutes. Output lines should not have any character other than this number.
