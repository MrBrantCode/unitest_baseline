QUESTION:
Watson gave Sherlock a collection of arrays $V$. Here each $V_i$ is an array of variable length. It is guaranteed that if you merge the arrays into one single array, you'll get an array, $M$, of $n$ distinct integers in the range $[1,n]$. 

Watson asks Sherlock to merge $V$ into a sorted array. Sherlock is new to coding, but he accepts the challenge and writes the following algorithm:

$M\leftarrow[]$ (an empty array).

${k\leftarrow}$ number of arrays in the collection $V$.

While there is at least one non-empty array in $V$:

$T\leftarrow\left[\right]$ (an empty array) and $i\leftarrow1$.

While $i\leq k$:

If $V_i$ is not empty:
Remove the first element of $V_i$ and push it to $T$.
$i\leftarrow i+1$.

While $T$ is not empty:

Remove the minimum element of $T$ and push it to $M$.

Return $M$ as the output.

Let's see an example. Let V be $\{[3,5],[1],[2,4]\}$.

The image below demonstrates how Sherlock will do the merging according to the algorithm:

Sherlock isn't sure if his algorithm is correct or not. He ran Watson's input, $V$, through his pseudocode algorithm to produce an output, $M$, that contains an array of $n$ integers. However, Watson forgot the contents of $V$ and only has Sherlock's $M$ with him! Can you help Watson reverse-engineer $M$ to get the original contents of $V$?

Given $m$, find the number of different ways to create collection $V$ such that it produces $m$ when given to Sherlock's algorithm as input. As this number can be quite large, print it modulo $10^9+7$.

Notes:

Two collections of arrays are different if one of the following is true:

Their sizes are different.
Their sizes are the same but at least one array is present in one collection but not in the other.

Two arrays, $A$ and $B$, are different if one of the following is true:

Their sizes are different.
Their sizes are the same, but there exists an index $i$ such that $a_i\neq b_i$.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, $n$, denoting the size of array $M$. 

The second line contains $n$ space-separated integers describing the respective values of $m_0,m_1,\ldots,m_{n-1}$.

Constraints

$1\leq n\leq1200$    
$1\leq m_i\leq n$    

Output Format

Print the number of different ways to create collection $V$, modulo $10^9+7$.

Sample Input 0
3
1 2 3

Sample Output 0
4

Explanation 0

There are four distinct possible collections:

$V=\{[1,2,3]\}$ 
$V=\{[1],[2],[3]\}$
$V=\{[1,3],[2]\}$
$V=\{[1],[2,3]\}$.

Thus, we print the result of $4\ \text{mod}\ (10^9+7)=4$ as our answer.

Sample Input 1
2
2 1

Sample Output 1
1

Explanation 1

The only distinct possible collection is $V=\{[2,1]\}$, so we print the result of $1\:\text{mod}\:(10^9+7)=1$ as our answer.
