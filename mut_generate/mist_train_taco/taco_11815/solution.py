QUESTION:
You are given a palindromic string $s$ of length $n$.

You have to count the number of indices $i$ $(1 \le i \le n)$ such that the string after removing $s_i$ from $s$ still remains a palindrome.

For example, consider $s$ = "aba"

If we remove $s_1$ from $s$, the string becomes "ba" which is not a palindrome.

If we remove $s_2$ from $s$, the string becomes "aa" which is a palindrome.

If we remove $s_3$ from $s$, the string becomes "ab" which is not a palindrome.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. For example, "abba", "a", "fef" are palindromes whereas "codeforces", "acd", "xy" are not.


-----Input-----

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $t$ $(1 \leq t \leq 10^3)$  — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer $n$ $(2 \leq n \leq 10^5)$  — the length of string $s$.

The second line of each test case contains a string $s$ consisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that $s$ is a palindrome.

It is guaranteed that sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, output a single integer  — the number of indices $i$ $(1 \le i \le n)$ such that the string after removing $s_i$ from $s$ still remains a palindrome.


-----Examples-----

Input
3
3
aba
8
acaaaaca
2
dd
Output
1
4
2


-----Note-----

The first test case is described in the statement.

In the second test case, the indices $i$ that result in palindrome after removing $s_i$ are $3, 4, 5, 6$. Hence the answer is $4$.

In the third test case, removal of any of the indices results in "d" which is a palindrome. Hence the answer is $2$.
