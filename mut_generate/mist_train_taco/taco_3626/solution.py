QUESTION:
You are given an array of N integers A[0], A[1], …, A[N-1], and an integer k. Your task is to make all the elements of the given array equal in a minimum number of ‘moves’.  All the elements of the array are non-negative. In each ‘move,’ you may add or subtract k from any element of the array. Give the answer modulo 10^{9}+7.
Example 1:
Input: N = 4, k = 2
A = {7, 5, 21, 17}
Output: 13
Explaination: We can add k = 2 to A[1] 
once and subtract k = 2 from A[2] seven 
times and from A[3] five times.The 
resulting array would be- 7 7 7 7. 
Number of moves = 1 + 7 + 5 = 13.
Example 2:
Input: N = 4, k = 3
A = {7, 5, 21, 17}
Output: -1
Explaination: No matter how many moves 
are made, all the elements of the array 
cannot be made equal.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function equalizeArray() which takes N, k, and A as input parameters and returns the minimum number of moves to make all the elements of the array equal. Return -1 if it is not possible.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N*logN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{6}
1 ≤ k, A[i] ≤ 1000
