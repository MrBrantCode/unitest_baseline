QUESTION:
Hossam woke up bored, so he decided to create an interesting array with his friend Hazem.

Now, they have an array $a$ of $n$ positive integers, Hossam will choose a number $a_i$ and Hazem will choose a number $a_j$.

Count the number of interesting pairs $(a_i, a_j)$ that meet all the following conditions:

$1 \le i, j \le n$;

$i \neq j$;

The absolute difference $|a_i - a_j|$ must be equal to the maximum absolute difference over all the pairs in the array. More formally, $|a_i - a_j| = \max_{1 \le p, q \le n} |a_p - a_q|$.


-----Input-----

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$), which denotes the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$).

The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^5$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each test case print an integer — the number of interesting pairs $(a_i, a_j)$.


-----Examples-----

Input
2
5
6 2 3 8 1
6
7 2 8 3 2 10
Output
2
4


-----Note-----

In the first example, the two ways are:

Hossam chooses the fourth number $8$ and Hazem chooses the fifth number $1$.

Hossam chooses the fifth number $1$ and Hazem chooses the fourth number $8$.

In the second example, the four ways are:

Hossam chooses the second number $2$ and Hazem chooses the sixth number $10$.

Hossam chooses the sixth number $10$ and Hazem chooses the second number $2$.

Hossam chooses the fifth number $2$ and Hazem chooses the sixth number $10$.

Hossam chooses the sixth number $10$ and Hazem chooses the fifth number $2$.
