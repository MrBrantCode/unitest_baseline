QUESTION:
Given two numbers N and P, the task is to check if unit digit of N and N^{P}^{ }are the same or not. 
Example 1:
Input: N = "2", P = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: Unit digit of 2^{1} is 2, 
which is equals to 2
Example 2:
Input: N = "4", P = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: Unit digit of 4^{2} is 6,
which is not equals to 4 
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function unitDigit() which takes a string N and an integer P as inputs and returns the boolean value. 
Expected Time Complexity: O(|P|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
Constraints:
1 <= |N| <= 50
1 <= P <= 1000

    Checks if the unit digit of N is the same as the unit digit of N^P.

    Parameters:
    - N (str): The base number as a string.
    - P (int): The exponent.

    Returns:
    - bool: True if the unit digits are the same, False otherwise.
