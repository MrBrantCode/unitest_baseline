QUESTION:
Given an array of size n which contains all elements occurring in multiples of K, except one element which doesn't occur in multiple of K. Find that unique element.
 
Example 1:
Input : 
n = 7, k = 3
arr[] = {6, 2, 5, 2, 2, 6, 6}
Output : 
5
Explanation:
Every element appears 3 times except 5.
 
Example 2:
Input  : 
n = 5, k = 4
arr[] = {2, 2, 2, 10, 2}
Output :
10
Explanation:
Every element appears 4 times except 10.
 
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findUnique() which takes the array A[], its size N and an integer K as inputs and returns the element with single occurence.
 
Expected Time Complexity: O(N. Log(A[i]) )
Expected Auxiliary Space: O( Log(A[i]) )
 
Constraints:
3<= N<=2*10^{5}
2<= K<=2*10^{5}
1<= A[i]<=10^{9}
