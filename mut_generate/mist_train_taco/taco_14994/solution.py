QUESTION:
You are given a hexagonal grid consisting of two rows, each row consisting of $n$ cells. The cells of the first row are labelled $a_1,a_2,\ldots a_n$ and the cells of the second row are labelled $b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n$.  

For example, for $n=6$:

(Note that the $b_i$ is connected with $a_{i+1}$.)

Your task is to tile this grid with $2\times1$ tiles that look like the following:

As you can see above, there are three possible orientations in which a tile can be placed.

Your goal is to tile the whole grid such that every cell is covered by a tile, and no two tiles occupy the same cell. To add to the woes, certain cells of the hexagonal grid are blackened. No tile must occupy a blackened cell.

Is it possible to tile the grid?

Here's an example. Suppose we want to tile this grid:

Then we can do the tiling as follows:

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer $\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{t}}$, the number of test cases.  

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ denoting the length of the grid. 

The second line contains a binary string of length $n$. The $i^{\cdot t h}$ character describes whether cell $a_i$ is blackened. 

The third line contains a binary string of length $n$. The $i^{\cdot th}$ character describes whether cell $b_i$ is blackened. 

A 0 corresponds to an empty cell and a 1 corresponds to blackened cell.  

Constraints

$1\leq t\leq100$  
$1\leq n\leq10$  

Output Format

For each test case, print YES if there exists at least one way to tile the grid, and NO otherwise.

The first test case in the sample input describes the example given in the problem statement above. 

For the second test case, there are two ways to fill it: either place two diagonal tiles side-by-side or place two horizontal tiles.
