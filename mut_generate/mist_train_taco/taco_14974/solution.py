QUESTION:
An arcade game player wants to climb to the top of the leaderboard and track their ranking. The game uses Dense Ranking, so its leaderboard works like this:  

The player with the highest score is ranked number $1$ on the leaderboard. 
Players who have equal scores receive the same ranking number, and the next player(s) receive the immediately following ranking number.

Example  

$ranked=[100,90,90,80]$ 

$player=[70,80,105]$  

The ranked players will have ranks $1$, $2$, $2$, and $3$, respectively.  If the player's scores are $70$, $\textbf{80}$ and $105$, their rankings after each game are $4^{th}$, $3^{rd}$ and $1^{st}$. Return $[4,3,1]$.

Function Description  

Complete the climbingLeaderboard function in the editor below.  

climbingLeaderboard has the following parameter(s):  

int ranked[n]: the leaderboard scores  
int player[m]: the player's scores  

Returns  

int[m]:  the player's rank after each new score

Input Format

The first line contains an integer $n$, the number of players on the leaderboard. 

The next line contains $n$ space-separated integers $\textit{ranked[i]}$, the leaderboard scores in decreasing order. 

The next line contains an integer, $m$, the number games the player plays. 

The last line contains $m$ space-separated integers $\textit{player}[j]$, the game scores.

Constraints

$1\leq n\leq2\times10^5$
$1\leq m\leq2\times10^5$
$0\leq\textit{ranked[i]}\leq10^9$ for $0\leq i<n$
$0\leq\textit{player}[j]\leq10^9$ for $0\leq j\lt m$
The existing leaderboard, $\textit{ranked}$, is in descending order.
The player's scores, $\textit{player}$, are in ascending order.

Subtask

For $\textbf{60\%}$ of the maximum score:

$1\leq n\leq200$
$1\leq m\leq200$
