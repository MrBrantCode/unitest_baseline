QUESTION:
We have the numbers with different colours with the sequence: ['red', 'yellow', 'blue'].

That sequence colours the numbers in the following way:

 1   2   3    4    5   6  7   8   9   10   11  12   13 .....

We have got the following recursive function:

  ```
f(1) = 1
f(n) = f(n - 1) + n
```

Some terms of this sequence with their corresponding colour are:

```
term   value   colour
1        1     "red"
2        3     "blue"
3        6     "blue"
4       10     "red"
5       15     "blue"
6       21     "blue"
7       28     "red"
```

The three terms of the same colour "blue", higher than 3, are: `[6, 15, 21]`

We need a function `same_col_seq(), that may receive three arguments:

- `val`, an integer number
- `k`, an integer number
- `colour`, the name of one of the three colours(red, yellow or blue), as a string.

The function will output a sorted array with the smallest `k` terms, having the same marked colour, but higher than `val`.

Let's see some examples:

```python
same_col_seq(3, 3, 'blue') == [6, 15, 21]
same_col_seq(100, 4, 'red') == [136, 190, 253, 325]
```

The function may output an empty list if it does not find terms of the sequence with the wanted colour in the range [val, 2* k * val]

```python
same_col_seq(250, 6, 'yellow') == []
```

That means that the function did not find any "yellow" term in the range `[250, 3000]`
 
Tests will be with the following features:

* Nmber of tests: `100`
* `100 < val < 1000000`
* `3 < k < 20`

    R = [[], [], []]
    colours = ['blue', 'red', 'yellow']
    
    for i in range(10000):
        D[i] = D.get(i - 1, 0) + i
        R[D[i] % 3].append(D[i])
    
    # Determine the index of the colour in the colours list
    colour_index = colours.index(colour)
    
    # Filter terms greater than val and return the first k terms
    result = [e for e in R[colour_index] if e > val]
    
    return result[:k]
