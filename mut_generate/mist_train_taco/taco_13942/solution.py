QUESTION:
Given a Matrix mat of N*N size, the task is to complete the function constructLinkedMatrix(), that constructs a 2D linked list representation of the given matrix.
Input : 2D matrix 
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
Output :
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> NULL
|    |    |
v    v    v
4 -> 5 -> 6 -> NULL
|    |    |
v    v    v
7 -> 8 -> 9 -> NULL
|    |    |
v    v    v
NULL NULL NULL
Input:
The fuction takes 2 argument as input, first the 2D matrix mat[][] and second an integer variable N, denoting the size of the matrix.
There will be T test cases and for each test case the function will be called separately.
Output:
The function must return the reference pointer to the head of the linked list.
Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=150
Example:
Input:
2
3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
2
1 2 3 4
Output:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1 2 3 4
Note:The Input/Ouput format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.
