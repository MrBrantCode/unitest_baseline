QUESTION:
Ishaan is trapped in a city full of walls. To escape from there, it needs to climb N walls, one after the other. He can climb a wall if its height is atmost K.
Ishaan also has a superpower. He can reduce the height of a wall H by K by using his superpower. Since he can't use this power many times, calculate the minimum number of times he has to use this power to go over all the walls.
Example 1:
Ã¢â¬â¹Input : arr[ ] = {5, 3, 2, 6, 8} and K = 5
Output : 2
Explanation:
Heights : 5 3 2 6 8 Ishaan can climb a 
wall with height atmost 5. So he climbs 
the first 3 walls easily. Now he has to 
use his power to reduce the height of the 
4th wall. After using his power, heights 
: 5 3 2 1 8, Now to climb the last wall, 
he again uses his power. Final heights 
: 5 3 2 1 3
Ã¢â¬â¹Example 2:
Input : arr[ ] = {2, 6, 4, 8, 1, 6} and K = 4 
Output :  3 
 
Your Task:
This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function ReducingWalls() that takes an array (arr), sizeOfArray (n), an integer K and return the minimum number of times he has to use this power to go over all the walls The driver code takes care of the printing.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
 
Constraints :
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}
1 ≤ K ≤ 10^{5}
1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 10^{9}
