QUESTION:
Given two array A[0….N-1] and B[0….M-1] of size N and M respectively, representing two numbers such that every element of arrays represent a digit. For example, A[] = { 1, 2, 3} and B[] = { 2, 1, 4 } represent 123 and 214 respectively. The task is to find the sum of both the numbers.
Example 1:
Input : A[] = {1, 2}, B[] = {2, 1}
Output : 33
Explanation:
N=2, and A[]={1,2}
M=2, and B[]={2,1}
Number represented by first array is 12.
Number represented by second array is 21
Sum=12+21=33
 
Example 2:
Input : A[] = {9, 5, 4, 9}, B[] = {2, 1, 4} 
Output : 9763 
Your Task:
This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function calc_Sum() that takes an array (a), sizeOfArray (n), an array (b), sizeOfArray (m), and return the sum . The driver code takes care of the printing.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N + M).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N + M).
 
Constraints:
2 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}
2 ≤ M ≤ 10^{5}
