QUESTION:
Given an array arr of size n. Print all the numbers less than k and should be such that the difference between every adjacent digit should be 1 in the array.
Note: Return empty list if no such number present, driver code will automatically print -1.
Example 1:
Input:
n = 8, k = 54
arr[] = {7, 98, 56, 43, 45, 23, 12, 8}
Output: 43 45 23 12
Explanation: 43 45 23 12 all these numbers have adjacent 
digits diff as 1 and they areless than 54.
Example 2:
Input:
n = 10, k = 1000
arr[] = {87, 89, 45, 235, 465, 765, 123, 987, 499, 655}
Output: 87 89 45 765 123 987
Explanation: 87 89 45 765 123 987 all these numbers have adjacent
digits diff as 1 and they areless than 1000.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getDigitDiff1AndLessK() which takes the array of integers arr, n and k as parameters and returns a list of integer denoting the answer.
Expected Time Complexity:O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space:O(1)
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^{7}
1 <= k, arr[i] <= 10^{18}
