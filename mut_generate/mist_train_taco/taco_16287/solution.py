QUESTION:
There is a hacker named "Vijay" who has developed a method to check whether an id at some social networking site is fake or real using its username.
His method includes: if the number of distinct consonent characters in one's user name is odd, then the user is a male, otherwise a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help Vijay to determine the gender of this user by his method. Ignore the vowels.
Note: The input only contains lowercase English alphabets.
Example 1 -
Input
a = "jpmztf"
Output:
SHE!
Explanation:
There are 6 distinct consonent characters in "jpmztf".
These characters are: "j", "p", "m", "z", "t", "f".
So jpmztf is a female and you should print "SHE!".
Example 2 - 
Input :
a = "plkaitw"
Output:
HE!
Explanation : 
There are 5 distinct consonent characters in "plkaitw".
These characters are: "p"," l ","k","t"and"w" as others are vowels.
So plkaitw is a male and you should print "HE!".
 
Your Task :
Complete the function solve() that receives the string a and returns the answer.
 
Expected Time Complexity :O(|a|)
Expected Space Complexity :O(1)
 
Constraints:
1<=Length of string<=1000
