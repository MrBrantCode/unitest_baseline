QUESTION:
Given a set of $n$ intervals, find the size of its largest possible subset of intervals such that no three intervals in the subset share a common point.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{~S~}}$, denoting the number of interval sets you must find answers for. The $s\cdot(n+1)$ subsequent lines describe each of the $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{~S~}}$ interval sets as follows:

The first line contains an integer, $n$, denoting the number of intervals in the list. 
Each line $\boldsymbol{i}$ of the $n$ subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective starting ($a_i$) and ending ($b_i$) boundaries of an interval.

Constraints

$1\leq s\leq100$
$2\leq n\leq1000$  
$1\leq a_i\leq b_i\leq10^9$

Output Format

For each of the $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{~S~}}$ interval sets, print an integer denoting the size of the largest possible subset of intervals in the given set such that no three points in the subset overlap.

Explanation

For set $\boldsymbol{s_{0}}$, all three intervals fall on point $2$ so we can only choose any $2$ of the intervals. Thus, we print $2$ on a new line.

For set $\boldsymbol{S_{1}}$, all three intervals span the range from $\mbox{1}$ to $5$ so we can only choose any $2$ of them. Thus, we print $2$ on a new line.

For set $s_2$, we can choose all $\begin{array}{c}4\end{array}$ intervals without having more than two of them overlap at any given point. Thus, we print $\begin{array}{c}4\end{array}$ on a new line.

For set $s_3$, the intervals $[1,10]$, $[1,3]$, and $[3,6]$ all overlap at point $3$, so we must only choose $2$ of these intervals to combine with the last interval, $[7,10]$, for a total of $3$ qualifying intervals. Thus, we print $3$ on a new line.
