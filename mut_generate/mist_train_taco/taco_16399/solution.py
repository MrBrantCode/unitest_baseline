QUESTION:
Jack and Daniel are friends.  They want to encrypt their conversations so that they can save themselves from interception by a detective agency so they invent a new cipher.  

Every message is encoded to its binary representation. Then it is written down $\boldsymbol{\mbox{k}}$ times, shifted by $0,1,\cdots,k-1$ bits. Each of the columns is XORed together to get the final encoded string.

If $b=1001011$ and $k=4$ it looks like so:  

1001011     shift 0 
01001011    shift 1
001001011   shift 2
0001001011  shift 3
----------
1110101001  <- XORed/encoded string s

Now we have to decode the message.  We know that $k=4$.  The first digit in $s=1$ so our output string is going to start with $1$.  The next two digits are also $1$, so they must have been XORed with $0$.  We know the first digit of our $4^{th}$ shifted string is a $\mbox{I}$ as well.  Since the $4^{th}$ digit of $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{~S~}}$ is $0$, we XOR that with our $1$ and now know there is a $1$ in the $4^{th}$ position of the original string.  Continue with that logic until the end.

Then the encoded message $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{~S~}}$ and the key $\boldsymbol{\mbox{k}}$ are sent to Daniel.   

Jack is using this encoding algorithm and asks Daniel to implement a decoding algorithm. 
Can you help Daniel implement this?  

Function Description  

Complete the cipher function in the editor below.  It should return the decoded string.  

cipher has the following parameter(s):  

k: an integer that represents the number of times the string is shifted 
s: an encoded string of binary digits

Input Format

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $\boldsymbol{\mbox{k}}$, the length of the original decoded string and the number of shifts. 

The second line contains the encoded string $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{~S~}}$ consisting of $n+k-1$ ones and zeros.  

Constraints

$1\leq n\leq10^{6}$ 

$1\leq k\leq10^6$ 

$|s|=n+k-1$ 

It is guaranteed that $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{~S~}}$ is valid.  

Output Format

Return the decoded message of length $n$, consisting of ones and zeros.
