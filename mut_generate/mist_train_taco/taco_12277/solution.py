QUESTION:
Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given n days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.

The flower grows as follows: 

  * If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies. 
  * If the flower is watered in the i-th day, it grows by 1 centimeter. 
  * If the flower is watered in the i-th and in the (i-1)-th day (i > 1), then it grows by 5 centimeters instead of 1. 
  * If the flower is not watered in the i-th day, it does not grow. 



At the beginning of the 1-st day the flower is 1 centimeter tall. What is its height after n days?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains the only integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (a_i = 0 or a_i = 1). If a_i = 1, the flower is watered in the i-th day, otherwise it is not watered.

Output

For each test case print a single integer k — the flower's height after n days, or -1, if the flower dies.
