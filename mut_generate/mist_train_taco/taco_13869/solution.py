QUESTION:
Jesse loves cookies and wants the sweetness of some cookies to be greater than value $\boldsymbol{\mbox{k}}$. To do this, two cookies with the least sweetness are repeatedly mixed. This creates a special combined cookie with:

sweetness $=(1\times$ Least sweet cookie $\mbox{t}$  $2\times$ 2nd least sweet cookie).

This occurs until all the cookies have a sweetness  $\geq k$.  

Given the sweetness of a number of cookies, determine the minimum number of operations required. If it is not possible, return $-1$.

Example 

$k=9$ 

$A=[2,7,3,6,4,6]$   

The smallest values are $2,3$. 

Remove them then return $2+2\times3=8$ to the array.  Now $A=[8,7,6,4,6]$. 

Remove $4,6$ and return $4+6\times2=16$ to the array.  Now $A=[16,8,7,6]$. 

Remove $6,7$, return $6+2\times7=20$ and $A=[20,16,8,7]$. 

Finally, remove $8,7$ and return $7+2\times8=23$ to $\mbox{A}$.  Now $A=[23,20,16]$. 

All values are $\geq k=9$ so the process stops after $\begin{array}{c}4\end{array}$ iterations.  Return $\begin{array}{c}4\end{array}$.   

Function Description 

Complete the cookies function in the editor below.  

cookies has the following parameters:  

int k: the threshold value  
int A[n]: an array of sweetness values  

Returns  

int: the number of iterations required or $-1$  

Input Format

The first line has two space-separated integers, $n$ and $\boldsymbol{\mbox{k}}$, the size of $\boldsymbol{A\left[\right]}$ and  the minimum required sweetness respectively.   

The next line contains $n$ space-separated integers, $A[i]$.  

Constraints

$1\leq n\leq10^{6}$ 

$0\leq k\leq10^9$ 

$\textbf{0}\leq A[i]\leq10^6$  

Sample Input
STDIN               Function
-----               --------
6 7                 A[] size n = 6, k = 7
1 2 3 9 10 12       A = [1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 12]  

Sample Output
2

Explanation

Combine the first two cookies to create a cookie with sweetness $=1\times1+2\times2$ = $5$ 

After this operation, the cookies are $3,5,9,10,12$. 

Then, combine the cookies with sweetness $3$ and sweetness $5$, to create a cookie with resulting sweetness $=1\times3+2\times5$ = $13$ 

Now, the cookies are $9,10,12,13$. 

All the cookies have a sweetness $\geq7$. 
 
Thus, $2$ operations are required to increase the sweetness.
