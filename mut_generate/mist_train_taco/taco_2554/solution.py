QUESTION:
An array $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ is good if and only if for every subsegment $1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$, the following holds: $a_l + a_{l + 1} + \ldots + a_r = \frac{1}{2}(a_l + a_r) \cdot (r - l + 1)$.

You are given an array of integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. In one operation, you can replace any one element of this array with any real number. Find the minimum number of operations you need to make this array good.


-----Input-----

The first line of input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$): the number of test cases.

Each of the next $t$ lines contains the description of a test case.

In the first line you are given one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 70$): the number of integers in the array.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($-100 \leq a_i \leq 100$): the initial array.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum number of elements that you need to replace to make the given array good.


-----Examples-----

Input
5
4
1 2 3 4
4
1 1 2 2
2
0 -1
6
3 -2 4 -1 -4 0
1
-100
Output
0
2
0
3
0


-----Note-----

In the first test case, the array is good already.

In the second test case, one of the possible good arrays is $[1, 1, \underline{1}, \underline{1}]$ (replaced elements are underlined).

In the third test case, the array is good already.

In the fourth test case, one of the possible good arrays is $[\underline{-2.5}, -2, \underline{-1.5}, -1, \underline{-0.5}, 0]$.
