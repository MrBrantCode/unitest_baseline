QUESTION:
Vladik and Chloe decided to determine who of them is better at math. Vladik claimed that for any positive integer n he can represent fraction <image> as a sum of three distinct positive fractions in form <image>.

Help Vladik with that, i.e for a given n find three distinct positive integers x, y and z such that <image>. Because Chloe can't check Vladik's answer if the numbers are large, he asks you to print numbers not exceeding 109.

If there is no such answer, print -1.

Input

The single line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 104).

Output

If the answer exists, print 3 distinct numbers x, y and z (1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 109, x ≠ y, x ≠ z, y ≠ z). Otherwise print -1.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Examples

Input

3


Output
