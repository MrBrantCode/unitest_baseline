QUESTION:
Lena is preparing for an important coding competition that is preceded by a number of sequential preliminary contests. Initially, her luck balance is 0. She believes in "saving luck", and wants to check her theory. Each contest is described by two integers, $L[i]$ and $\boldsymbol{T[i]}$:

$L[i]$ is the amount of luck associated with a contest. If Lena wins the contest, her luck balance will decrease by $L[i]$; if she loses it, her luck balance will increase by $L[i]$.
$\boldsymbol{T[i]}$ denotes the contest's importance rating. It's equal to $\mbox{1}$ if the contest is important, and it's equal to $\mbox{0}$ if it's unimportant.

If Lena loses no more than $\boldsymbol{\mbox{k}}$ important contests, what is the maximum amount of luck she can have after competing in all the preliminary contests? This value may be negative.

Example 

$k=2$ 

$L=[5,1,4]$ 

$T=[1,1,0]$  

Contest		L[i]	T[i]
1		5	1
2		1	1
3		4	0

If Lena loses all of the contests, her will be $5+1+4=10$.  Since she is allowed to lose $2$ important contests, and there are only $2$ important contests, she can lose all three contests to maximize her luck at $10$.  

If $k=1$, she has to win at least $\mbox{1}$ of the $2$ important contests.  She would choose to win the lowest value important contest worth $\mbox{1}$.  Her final luck will be $5+4-1=8$.  

Function Description  

Complete the luckBalance function in the editor below.  

luckBalance has the following parameter(s):  

int k: the number of important contests Lena can lose  
int contests[n][2]: a 2D array of integers where each $contests[i]$ contains two integers that represent the luck balance and importance of the $i^{\mbox{th}}$ contest   

Returns   

int:  the maximum luck balance achievable   

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $\boldsymbol{\mbox{k}}$, the number of preliminary contests and the maximum number of important contests Lena can lose. 

Each of the next $n$ lines contains two space-separated integers, $L[i]$ and $\boldsymbol{T[i]}$, the contest's luck balance and its importance rating.

Constraints

$1\leq n\leq100$
$0\leq k\leq N$
$1\leq L[i]\leq10^4$
$T[i]\in\{0,1\}$

Sample Input

-----       --------
6 3         n = 6, k = 3
5 1         contests = [[5, 1], [2, 1], [1, 1], [8, 1], [10, 0], [5, 0]]
2 1
1 1
8 1
10 0
5 0

Sample Output
29

Explanation

There are $n=6$ contests. Of these contests, $\begin{array}{c}4\end{array}$ are important and she cannot lose more than $k=3$ of them. Lena maximizes her luck if she wins the $3^{rd}$ important contest (where $L[i]=1$) and loses all of the other five contests for a total luck balance of $5+2+8+10+5-1=29$.
