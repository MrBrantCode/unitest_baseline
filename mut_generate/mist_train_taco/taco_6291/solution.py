QUESTION:
Given a matrix Arr of size N x M. You are given position of submatrix as X_{1}, Y_{1} and X_{2}, Y_{2} inside the matrix. Find the sum of all elements inside that submatrix. Here X_{1}, Y_{1}, X_{2}, Y_{2} are 1-based.
Example 1:
Input: 
N = 5 , M = 6
Arr[][] = {{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6},
           {7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12},
           {13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18},
           {19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24},
           {25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30}}
X_{1}=3, Y_{1}=4, X_{2}=4, Y_{2}=5
Output: 78
Explanation: Sum from cell starting at
position (3, 4) (1-based indexing) and 
ending at (4, 5) is 78.
Example 2:
Input: 
N = 3, M = 3
Arr[][] = {{9, 8, 7},{4, 2, 1},{6, 5, 3}}
X_{1}=1, Y_{1}=2, X_{2}=3, Y_{2}=3
Output: 26
Explanation: Sum from cell starting at
position (1, 2) (1-based indexing) and 
ending at (3, 3) is 26.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function subMatrixSum() which takes the array of booleans arr[][], n, m, x1, y1, x2 and y2 as parameters and returns an integer denoting the answer.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N*M)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints:
1 ≤ N, M ≤ 10^{3}
1 ≤ Arr[N][M] ≤ 10^{6}
1 <= X_{1}, X_{2 }<= N
1 <= Y_{1}, Y_{2 }<= M
