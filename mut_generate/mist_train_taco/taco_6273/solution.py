QUESTION:
Vlad found two positive numbers $a$ and $b$ ($a,b>0$). He discovered that $a \oplus b = \frac{a + b}{2}$, where $\oplus$ means the bitwise exclusive OR , and division is performed without rounding..

Since it is easier to remember one number than two, Vlad remembered only $a\oplus b$, let's denote this number as $x$. Help him find any suitable $a$ and $b$ or tell him that they do not exist.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input data contains the single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases in the test.

Each test case is described by a single integer $x$ ($1 \le x \le 2^{29}$) — the number that Vlad remembered.


-----Output-----

Output $t$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As the answer, output $a$ and $b$ ($0 < a,b \le 2^{32}$), such that $x = a \oplus b = \frac{a + b}{2}$. If there are several answers, output any of them. If there are no matching pairs, output -1.


-----Examples-----
