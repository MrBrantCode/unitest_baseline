QUESTION:
Read problems statements in [Mandarin Chinese], [Russian], and [Bengali] as well.

After solving programming problems for years, Chef has become lazy and decided to get a better physique by doing some weight lifting exercises.

On any regular day, Chef does $N$ exercises at times $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{N}$ (in minutes, all distinct) and each exercise provides a tension of $B_{1}, B_{2}, \ldots, B_{N}$ units. In the period between two consecutive exercises, his muscles relax $R$ units of tension per minute.

More formally, Chef's tension is described by a number $x$. Before any workouts, $x=0$. When he does a workout at time $A_{i}$, the tension $x$ instantly increases by $B_{i}$. Between workouts, the number $x$ decreases by $R$ units per minute, maximized with $0$.

Considering the time of exercise and hence tension to be negligible, find the maximum tension he will be feeling in his muscles during the entire period of his workout.

------ Input: ------

First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. 
Each testcase contains $3$ lines of input.
The first line will contain $2$ space-separated integers $N, R$, number of timestamps at which Chef performs his exercise, and units of tension relaxed per minute.
The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{N}$.
The third line contains $N$ space-separated integers $B_{1}, B_{2}, \ldots, B_{N}$.  

------ Output: ------
For each testcase, output in a single line the maximum amount of tension Chef will have in his muscles.

------ Constraints  ------
$1 ≤ T ≤ 10$
$1 ≤ N ≤ 5\cdot 10^{4}$
$1 ≤ R, B_{i} ≤ 10^{5}$
$1 ≤ A_{i} ≤ 10^{9}$
$A_{i - 1} < A_{i}$, for all $2≤ i≤ N$

----- explanation 1 ------ 
Test Case 1: Since there is only $1$ exercise, the maximum tension is equal to the tension provided by that exercise, i.e, $10$ units. 

Test Case 2: At time $t = 10$, Chef has $10$ units of tension. 

From $t = 10$ to $t = 11$, his muscles releases $2$ unit of tension and at $t = 11$, he further gains $10$ units of tension to have total of $10 - 2 + 10 = 18$ units of tension.

So the maximum tension Chef feels in his muscles is $18$ units.

Test Case 3: At time $t = 1$, Chef has $1$ unit of tension. 

From $t = 1$ to $t = 2$, his muscles releases $1$ unit of tension and at $t = 2$, he further gains $2$ units of tension to have total of $1 - 1 + 2 = 2$ units of tension.

From $t = 2$ to $t = 3$, his muscles releases $1$ unit of tension and at $t = 3$, he further gains $3$ units of tension to have total of $2 - 1 + 3 = 4$ units of tension. 

So the maximum tension Chef feels in his muscles is $4$ units.
