QUESTION:
The provided code stub will read in a dictionary containing key/value pairs of name:[marks] for a list of students.  Print the average of the marks array for the student name provided, showing 2 places after the decimal.  

Example 

$\textbf{marks key:value pairs are}$ 

$\text{'alpha'}:[20,30,40]$ 

$\text{'beta'}:[30,50,70]$ 

$\textbf{query_name}=\textbf{'beta'}$  

The query_name is 'beta'.  beta's average score is $(30+50+70)/3=50.0$.

Input Format

The first line contains the integer $n$, the number of students' records. The next $n$ lines contain the names and marks obtained by a student, each value separated by a space. The final line contains query_name, the name of a student to query.

Constraints

$2\leq n\leq10$  
$0\leq\textit{marks}[i]\leq100$  
$\textbf{length of marks arrays}=3$  

Output Format

Print one line: The average of the marks obtained by the particular student correct to 2 decimal places.
