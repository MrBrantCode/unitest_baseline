QUESTION:
Given a 2-D integer array A of order NXN, consisting of only zeroes and ones, find the row or column whose all elements form a palindrome. If more than one palindrome is found, the palindromes found in rows will have priority over the ones found in columns and within rows and columns, the one with lesser index gets the highest priority. Print the palindrome with the highest priority along with it's index and indication of it being a row or column.
 
Example 1:
Input:
N = 3
A[][] = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]
Output: 1 R
Explanation:
In the first test case, 0-1-0 is a palindrome 
occuring in a row having index 1.
 
Example 2:
Input:
N = 2
A[][] = [[1, 0], [1, 0]]
Output: 0 C
Explanation:
1-1 occurs before 0-0 in the 0th column.
And there is no palindrome in the two rows.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function pattern() which takes the integer N and 2-d array A[][] as input parameters and returns the First, the index of either row or column(0 based indexing) , followed by either of the two characters 'R' or 'C', representing whether the palindrome was found in a row or column. All the characters return as output should be space separated. If no palindrome is found, return -1 as string.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N^{2})
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
 
Constraints:
1<=N<=50
A[i][j]=0 or 1, where i and j denote row and column indices of the matrix respectively.
