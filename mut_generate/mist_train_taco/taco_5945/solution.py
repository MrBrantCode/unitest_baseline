QUESTION:
Little X has met the following problem recently. 

Let's define f(x) as the sum of digits in decimal representation of number x (for example, f(1234) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4). You are to calculate <image>

Of course Little X has solved this problem quickly, has locked it, and then has tried to hack others. He has seen the following C++ code: 
    
    
      
        ans = solve(l, r) % a;  
        if (ans <= 0)  
          ans += a;  
      
    

This code will fail only on the test with <image>. You are given number a, help Little X to find a proper test for hack.

Input

The first line contains a single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 1018).

Output

Print two integers: l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10200) — the required test data. Leading zeros aren't allowed. It's guaranteed that the solution exists.
