QUESTION:
Let a and b be binary numbers of length n (MSB to the left). The following commands may be performed:

set_a idx x: Set $a[i dx]$ to $\boldsymbol{x}$, where $0\leq idx<n$ and  $a[i dx]$ is $\text{id}x^{\text{th}}$ least significant bit of $a$.  
set_b idx x: Set $b[idx]$ to $\boldsymbol{x}$, where $0\leq idx<n$ and  $b[idx]$ is $\text{id}x^{\text{th}}$ least significant bit of $\boldsymbol{b}$.  
get_c idx: Print $c[idx]$, where $c[idx]=a[idx]+b[idx]$ and $0\leq idx\leq n+1$.  

Given $a,b$, and a list of commands, create a string made of the results of each $\text{get_c}$ call, the only command that produces output.  For example, $\boldsymbol{a}=\boldsymbol{000}$ and $b=111$ so the length of the numbers is $n=3$.  Print an answer string that contains the results of all commands on one line.  A series of commands and their results follow:

Starting 

ans = '' (empty string) 

a   b 

000 111 

set_a 1 1 

010 111 

set_b 0 1 

010 111 

get_c 3 

a + b = 1001 

ans = '1' 

010 111 

get_c 4 

a + b = 01001 

ans = '10' 

Note: When the command is get_c 4, $\textbf{C}$  had to be padded to the left with a $0$ to be long enough to return a value.  

Function Description  

Complete the changeBits function in the editor below.  For each get_c command, it should print either a 0 or a 1 without a newline until all commands have been processed. At that point, add a newline.   

changeBits has the following parameters: 

- a, b: two integers represented as binary strings 

- queries[queries[0]-queries[n-1]]: an array of query strings in the format described  

Input Format

The first line of input contains two space-separated integers, $n$ and $\textit{q}$, the length of the binary representations of $a$ and $\boldsymbol{b}$, and the number of commands, respectively. 

The second and third lines each contain a string representation of $a$ and $\boldsymbol{b}$. 

The following $\textit{q}$ lines each contain a command string $\textit{queries}[i]$ as described above.  

Constraints

$1\leq n\leq1000000$ 

$1\leq q\leq5000000$  

Output Format

For each query of the type $\text{get_c}$, output a single digit 0 or 1. Output must be placed on a single line.

Sample Input 0
5 5
00000
11111
set_a 0 1
get_c 5
get_c 1
set_b 2 0
get_c 5

Sample Output 0
100

Explanation 0

set_a 0 1 sets 00000 to 00001
C = A + B = 00001 + 11111 = 100000, so get_c[5] = 1
from the above computation get_c[1] = 0
set_b 2 0 sets 11111 to 11011
C = A + B = 00001 + 11011 = 011100, so get_c[5]  = 0

The output is hence concatenation of 1, 0 and 0  = 100
