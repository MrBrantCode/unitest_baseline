QUESTION:
Given a number N. You can perform an operation on it multiple times, in which you can change digit 5 to 6 and vice versa.
You have to return the sum of the maximum number and the minimum number which can be obtained by performing such operations.
Example 1:
Input: N = 35
Output: 71
Explanation: The maximum number which can be
formed is 36 and the minimum number which can
be formed is 35 itself. 
Example 2:
Input: N = 22
Output: 44
Explanation: The maximum number and minimum
number which can be formed is 22 itself.
Your Task:
You need not take any input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function performOperation() which takes a single Number as input and returns the sum of maximum and minimum number.
Expected Time Complexity: O(Log_{10}N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Log_{10}N)
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{18}
