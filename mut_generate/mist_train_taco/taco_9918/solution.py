QUESTION:
Given an array Arr of positive integers of size N where every element appears even times except for one. Find that number occuring odd number of times.
Example 1:
Input: 
N = 5
Arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2}
Output: 2
Explanation: In the given array all
element appear two times except 2
which appears thrice.
Example 2:
Input: 
N = 7
Arr[] = {8, 8, 7, 7, 6, 6, 1}
Output: 1
Explanation: In the given array all
element appear two times except 1
which appears once.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getSingle() which takes the array of integers arr[] and n as parameters and returns a integer denoting the answer.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^{7}
0 <= Arr_{i} <= 10^{8}
