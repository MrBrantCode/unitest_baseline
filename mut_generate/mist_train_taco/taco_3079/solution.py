QUESTION:
We will say that two integer sequences of length N, x_1, x_2, ..., x_N and y_1, y_2, ..., y_N, are similar when |x_i - y_i| \leq 1 holds for all i (1 \leq i \leq N).

In particular, any integer sequence is similar to itself.

You are given an integer N and an integer sequence of length N, A_1, A_2, ..., A_N.

How many integer sequences b_1, b_2, ..., b_N are there such that b_1, b_2, ..., b_N is similar to A and the product of all elements, b_1 b_2 ... b_N, is even?

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 10
* 1 \leq A_i \leq 100

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
