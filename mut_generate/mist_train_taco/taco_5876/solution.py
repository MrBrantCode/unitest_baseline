Input / output example

Input example 1


3 0 10


Output example 1


Four


* I want to get 3 coins per login and collect 10 coins.
* JOI can get 12 coins by logging in for 4 consecutive days from Monday.
* Since you cannot get more than 10 coins by logging in 3 times or less, the minimum number of times JOI must log in is 4. Therefore, 4 is output.



Input example 2


1 2 10


Output example 2


8


* You can get 1 coin for each login. Apart from that, you can get 2 coins by logging in for a week in a row. I want to collect 10 coins.
* If you log in consecutively from Monday to Sunday, you will get 2 coins in addition to 7 daily coins, so you will get a total of 9 coins. Therefore, if you log in one more time, you will get 10 coins.
* Since you cannot get more than 10 coins by logging in 7 times or less, the minimum number of times JOI must log in is 8. Therefore, 8 is output.
