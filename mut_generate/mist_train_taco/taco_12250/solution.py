QUESTION:
You are given $n$ of integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. Process $q$ queries of two types:

query of the form "0 $x_j$": add the value $x_j$ to all even elements of the array $a$,

query of the form "1 $x_j$": add the value $x_j$ to all odd elements of the array $a$.

Note that when processing the query, we look specifically at the odd/even value of $a_i$, not its index.

After processing each query, print the sum of the elements of the array $a$.

Please note that the answer for some test cases won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language (like long long for C++).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains an integer $t$ $(1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases.

The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \leq n$, $q \leq 10^5$) — the length of array $a$ and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains exactly $n$ integers: $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$) — elements of the array $a$.

The following $q$ lines contain queries as two integers $type_j$ and $x_j$ $(0 \leq type_j \leq 1$, $1 \leq x_j \leq 10^4$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of values $n$ over all test cases in a test does not exceed $10^5$. Similarly, the sum of values $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.


-----Output-----

For each test case, print $q$ numbers: the sum of the elements of the array $a$ after processing a query.

-----Note-----

In the first test case, the array $a = [2]$ after the first query.

In the third test case, the array $a$ is modified as follows: $[1, 3, 2, 4, 10, 48]$ $\rightarrow$ $[7, 9, 2, 4, 10, 48]$ $\rightarrow$ $[7, 9, 7, 9, 15, 53]$ $\rightarrow$ $[7, 9, 7, 9, 15, 53]$ $\rightarrow$ $[10, 12, 10, 12, 18, 56]$ $\rightarrow$ $[22, 24, 22, 24, 30, 68]$ $\rightarrow$ $[23, 25, 23, 25, 31, 69]$.
