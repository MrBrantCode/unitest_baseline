QUESTION:
Given an integer array arr of size n, you need to sum the elements of arr.
Example 1:
Input:
n = 3
arr[] = {3 2 1}
Output: 6
Example 2:
Input:
n = 4
arr[] = {1 2 3 4}
Output: 10
Your Task:
You need to complete the function sumElement() that takes arr and n and returns the sum. The printing is done by the driver code.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10^{3}
1 <= arr_{i }<= 10^{4}
