QUESTION:
Watson gives Sherlock an array of integers.  Given the endpoints of an integer range, for all $M$ in that inclusive range, determine the minimum( abs(arr[i]-M) for all $1\leq i\leq|arr|$) ).  Once that has been determined for all integers in the range, return the $M$ which generated the maximum of those values.  If there are multiple $M$'s that result in that value, return the lowest one.  

For example, your array $arr=[3,5,7,9]$ and your range is from $p=6$ to $q=8$ inclusive.

M	|arr[1]-M|	|arr[2]-M|	|arr[3]-M|	|arr[4]-M|	Min
6	   3		   1		   1		   3		 1
7	   4		   2		   0		   2		 0
8	   5		   3		   1		   1		 1

We look at the Min column and see the maximum of those three values is $1$.  Two $M$'s result in that answer so we choose the lower value, $6$.

Function Description  

Complete the sherlockAndMinimax function in the editor below.  It should return an integer as described.  

sherlockAndMinimax has the following parameters: 

- arr: an array of integers 

- p: an integer that represents the lowest value of the range for $M$ 

- q: an integer that represents the highest value of the range for $M$  

Input Format

The first line contains an integer $n$, the number of elements in $arr$. 

The next line contains $n$ space-separated integers $i$. 

The third line contains two space-separated integers $p$ and $q$, the inclusive endpoints for the range of $M$.       

Constraints

$1\leq n\leq10^2$ 

$1\leq ar r[i]\leq10^9$ 

$1\leq p\leq q\leq10^9$  

Output Format

Print the value of $M$ on a line.

Sample Input
3
5 8 14
4 9

Sample Output
4

Explanation

$arr=[5,8,14],range=[4-9]$

M	|arr[1]-M|	|arr[2]-M|	|arr[3]-M|	Min
4	   1		   4		   10		 1
5	   0		   3		    9		 0
6	   1		   2		    8		 1
7	   2		   1		    7		 1
8	   3		   0		    6		 0
9	   4		   1		    5		 1

For $M=4,6,7$, or $9$, the result is $1$. Since we have to output the smallest of the multiple solutions, we print $4$.
