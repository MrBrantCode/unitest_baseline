QUESTION:
Tax Rate Changed

VAT (value-added tax) is a tax imposed at a certain rate proportional to the sale price.

Our store uses the following rules to calculate the after-tax prices.

* When the VAT rate is x%, for an item with the before-tax price of p yen, its after-tax price of the item is p (100+x) / 100 yen, fractions rounded off.
* The total after-tax price of multiple items paid at once is the sum of after-tax prices of the items.



The VAT rate is changed quite often. Our accountant has become aware that "different pairs of items that had the same total after-tax price may have different total after-tax prices after VAT rate changes." For example, when the VAT rate rises from 5% to 8%, a pair of items that had the total after-tax prices of 105 yen before can now have after-tax prices either of 107, 108, or 109 yen, as shown in the table below.

Before-tax prices of two items| After-tax price with 5% VAT| After-tax price with 8% VAT
---|---|---
20, 80| 21 + 84 = 105| 21 + 86 = 107
2, 99| 2 + 103 = 105| 2 + 106 = 108
13, 88| 13 + 92 = 105| 14 + 95 = 109



Our accountant is examining effects of VAT-rate changes on after-tax prices. You are asked to write a program that calculates the possible maximum total after-tax price of two items with the new VAT rate, knowing their total after-tax price before the VAT rate change.

Input

The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset is in one line, which consists of three integers x, y, and s separated by a space. x is the VAT rate in percent before the VAT-rate change, y is the VAT rate in percent after the VAT-rate change, and s is the sum of after-tax prices of two items before the VAT-rate change. For these integers, 0 < x < 100, 0 < y < 100, 10 < s < 1000, and x ≠ y hold. For before-tax prices of items, all possibilities of 1 yen through s-1 yen should be considered.

The end of the input is specified by three zeros separated by a space.

Output

For each dataset, output in a line the possible maximum total after-tax price when the VAT rate is changed to y%.
