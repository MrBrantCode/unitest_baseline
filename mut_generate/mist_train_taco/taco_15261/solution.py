QUESTION:
# Task
A masked number is a string that consists of digits and one asterisk (`*`) that should be replaced by exactly one digit. Given a masked number `s`, find all the possible options to replace the asterisk with a digit to produce an integer divisible by 6.


# Input/Output

`[input]` string `s`

A masked number.

`1 ≤ inputString.length ≤ 10000.`

`[output]` a string array

Sorted array of strings representing all non-negative integers that correspond to the given mask and are divisible by 6.

# Example

For `s = "1*0"`, the output should be `["120", "150", "180"].`

For `s = "*1"`, the output should be `[].`

For `s = "1234567890123456789012345678*0"`, 

the output should be 
```
[
"123456789012345678901234567800",
"123456789012345678901234567830",
"123456789012345678901234567860",
"123456789012345678901234567890"]```
As you can see, the masked number may be very large ;-)
