QUESTION:
We have N points numbered 1 to N arranged in a line in this order.

Takahashi decides to make an undirected graph, using these points as the vertices. In the beginning, the graph has no edge. Takahashi will do M operations to add edges in this graph. The i-th operation is as follows:

* The operation uses integers L_i and R_i between 1 and N (inclusive), and a positive integer C_i. For every pair of integers (s, t) such that L_i \leq s < t \leq R_i, add an edge of length C_i between Vertex s and Vertex t.



The integers L_1, ..., L_M, R_1, ..., R_M, C_1, ..., C_M are all given as input.

Takahashi wants to solve the shortest path problem in the final graph obtained. Find the length of the shortest path from Vertex 1 to Vertex N in the final graph.

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq M \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq L_i < R_i \leq N
* 1 \leq C_i \leq 10^9

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N M
L_1 R_1 C_1
:
L_M R_M C_M


Output

Print the length of the shortest path from Vertex 1 to Vertex N in the final graph. If there is no shortest path, print `-1` instead.
