QUESTION:
Given a matrix mat[][] of n rows and m columns, consisting of 0’s and 1’s. The task is to complete the function findPerimeter which returns an integer denoting the perimeter of sub-figures consisting of only 1’s in the matrix.
For example
Perimeter of single 1 is 4 as it can be covered from all 4 side. Perimeter of double 11 is 6.
                            
|  1  |           |  1    1  |
                            
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two space separated n and m denoting the size of the matrix mat[][] . Then in the next line are n*m space separated values of the matrix.
Output:
For each test case in a new line print the perimeter of sub-figure consisting only 1’s in the matrix.
Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=n, m<=20
Example(To be used for expected output):
Input:
2
1 2
1 1 
3 3
1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0
Output:
6
8
Note:The Input/Ouput format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.
