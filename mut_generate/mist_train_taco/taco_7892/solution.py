QUESTION:
N Students of different heights are attending an assembly. The heights of the students are represented by an array H[]. The problem is that if a student has less or equal height than the student standing in front of him, then he/she cannot see the assembly. Find the minimum number of students to be removed such that all the remaining students can see the assembly.
 
Example 1:
Input:
N = 6
H[] = {9, 1, 2, 3, 1, 5}
Output:
2
Explanation:
We can remove the students at 0 and 4th index.
which will leave the students with heights
1,2,3, and 5.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 3
H[] = {1, 2, 3} 
Output :
0
Explanation:
All of the students are able to see the
assembly without removing anyone.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function removeStudents() which takes an integer N and an array H[ ] of size N as input parameters and returns the minimum number of students required to be removed to enable all the remaining students to see the assembly.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N logN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}
1 ≤ H[i] ≤ 10^{5}
