QUESTION:
Given an string S, representing a large interger. Return the largest-valued odd integer (as a string) that is substring of the given string S.
Note : A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. Null string ("") is also a substring.
Example 1:
Input: s = "504"
Output: "5"
Explanation: The only subtring "5" is odd number.
 
Example 2:
Input: s = "2042"
Output: ""
Explanation: All the possible non-empty substring have even value.
 
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maxOdd() which takes the string S as input and returns the largest-valued odd integer that is substring of the given string.
Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
Constraints:
1<=|S|<=2*10^{5}
S only consists of digits and does not contain any leading zeros.
