QUESTION:
Given an array arr[] of N positive integers. Push all the zeros of the given array to the right end of the array while maitaining the order of non-zero elements.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 5
Arr[] = {3, 5, 0, 0, 4}
Output: 3 5 4 0 0
Explanation: The non-zero elements
preserve their order while the 0
elements are moved to the right.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 4
Arr[] = {0, 0, 0, 4}
Output: 4 0 0 0
Explanation: 4 is the only non-zero
element and it gets moved to the left.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function pushZerosToEnd() which takes the array arr[] and its size n as input parameters and modifies arr[] in-place such that all the zeroes are moved to the right.  
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}
0 ≤ arr_{i} ≤ 10^{5}

    n (int): The size of the array.

    Returns:
    None: The function modifies the input array in-place.
