QUESTION:
Niwango created a playlist of N songs. The title and the duration of the i-th song are s_i and t_i seconds, respectively. It is guaranteed that s_1,\ldots,s_N are all distinct.

Niwango was doing some work while playing this playlist. (That is, all the songs were played once, in the order they appear in the playlist, without any pause in between.) However, he fell asleep during his work, and he woke up after all the songs were played. According to his record, it turned out that he fell asleep at the very end of the song titled X.

Find the duration of time when some song was played while Niwango was asleep.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 50
* s_i and X are strings of length between 1 and 100 (inclusive) consisting of lowercase English letters.
* s_1,\ldots,s_N are distinct.
* There exists an integer i such that s_i = X.
* 1 \leq t_i \leq 1000
* t_i is an integer.
