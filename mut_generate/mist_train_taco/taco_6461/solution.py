QUESTION:
In CODE FESTIVAL XXXX, there are N+1 participants from all over the world, including Takahashi.

Takahashi checked and found that the time gap (defined below) between the local times in his city and the i-th person's city was D_i hours. The time gap between two cities is defined as follows. For two cities A and B, if the local time in city B is d o'clock at the moment when the local time in city A is 0 o'clock, then the time gap between these two cities is defined to be min(d,24-d) hours. Here, we are using 24-hour notation. That is, the local time in the i-th person's city is either d o'clock or 24-d o'clock at the moment when the local time in Takahashi's city is 0 o'clock, for example.

Then, for each pair of two people chosen from the N+1 people, he wrote out the time gap between their cities. Let the smallest time gap among them be s hours.

Find the maximum possible value of s.

Constraints

* 1 \leq N \leq 50
* 0 \leq D_i \leq 12
* All input values are integers.
