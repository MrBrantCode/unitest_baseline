QUESTION:
Given an array of numbers form 0 to 9 of size N. Your task is to rearrange elements of the array such that after combining all the elements of the array number formed is maximum.
 
Example 1:
Input:
N = 5
A[] = {9, 0, 1, 3, 0}
Output:
93100
Explanation:
Largest number is 93100 which
can be formed from array digits.
 
Example 2:
Input:
N = 3
A[] = {1, 2, 3}
Output:
321
 
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function MaxNumber() which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and returns a single line a string denoting the largest number that can be achieved by rearranging the elements of the array.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^{7}
0 <= A_{i }<= 9

def MaxNumber(arr, n):
    # Sort the array in ascending order
    arr.sort()
    # Reverse the array to get descending order
    arr.reverse()
    # Convert each element to a string
    a = list(map(str, arr))
    # Join the string elements to form the largest number
    k = ''.join(a)
