QUESTION:
Given three distinct numbers A, B and C. Find the number with value in middle (Try to do it with minimum comparisons).
Example 1:
Input:
A = 978, B = 518, C = 300
Output:
518
Explanation:
Since 518>300 and 518<978, so 
518 is the middle element.
Example 2:
Input:
A = 162, B = 934, C = 200
Output:
200
Exaplanation:
Since 200>162 && 200<934,
So, 200 is the middle element.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything.Your task is to complete the function middle() which takes three integers A,B and C as input parameters and returns the number which has middle value.
Expected Time Complexity:O(1)
Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)
Constraints:
1<=A,B,C<=10^{9}
A,B,C are distinct.
