QUESTION:
Find the smallest number that can be framed using the series created by the digits obtained by raising the given number  (  "a"  ) to the power from 1 to  n  i.e.  a^1 , a^2 , a^3 .......a^n . We get  b1,b2 , b3 , ........... bn . 
Using all the digits  ( including repeating ones )  that appear inb1 ,b2 , b3 .... bn . Frame a number that contains all the digits ( including repeating ones )  and find out the combination of digits that make the smallest number of all possible combinations. Excluding or neglecting zeroes  ( " 0 " )  . 
Example 1:
Input : A = 9 and N = 4
Output : 1125667899
Explanation:
9^1 = 9
9^2 = 81
9^3 = 729
9^4  = 6561 
9 81 729 6561
We get  9817296561 .
Using 9817296561 number we need to find 
the smallest possible number that can be 
framed using other combinations of the 
samenumber .
1298796561
8799265611
2186561997
.
.
.
1125667899
The smallest possible number that can be 
framed is1125667899 . 
Example 2:
Input : A = 5 and N = 1
Output : 5
Your Task:
This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function tiny_miny() that takes two integers A, N, and return a string which is the smallest number out of all combinations .how many tabs are open at the end. The driver code takes care of the printing.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N^{2}LogA).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
 
Constraints:   
0 ≤ N ≤ 5
0 ≤ A ≤ 70
