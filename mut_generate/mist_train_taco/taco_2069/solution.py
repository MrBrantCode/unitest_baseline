QUESTION:
Given a graph which represents a flow network with N vertices numbered 1 to N and M edges.Find the maximum flow from vertex numbered 1 to vertex numbered N.
In a flow network,every edge has a flow capacity and the maximum flow of a path can't exceed the flow-capacity of an edge in the path.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 5, M =  4
Edges[]= {{1,2,1},{3,2,2},{4,2,3},{2,5,5}}
Output: 1 
Explanation: 
1 - 2 - 3
   / \
  4   5 
1 unit can flow from 1 -> 2 - >5 
 
Example 2:
Input:
N = 4, M = 4
Edges[] = {{1,2,8},{1,3,10},{4,2,2},{3,4,3}}
Output: 5 
Explanation:
  1 - 2 
  |   |
  3 - 4
3 unit can flow from 1 -> 3 -> 4
2 unit can flow from 1 -> 2 -> 4
Total max flow from 1 to N = 3+2=5
Your Task: 
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function solve() which takes the N (the number of vertices) ,M (the number of Edges) and the array Edges[] (Where Edges[i] denoting an undirected edge between Edges[i][0] and Edges[i][1] with a flow capacity of Edges[i][2]), and returns the integer denoting the maximum flow from 1 to N.
Expected Time Complexity: O(max_flow*M)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N+M)
Where max_flow is the maximum flow from 1 to N
Constraints:
1 <= N,M,Edges[i][2] <= 1000
1 <= Edges[i][0],Edges[i][1] <= N
