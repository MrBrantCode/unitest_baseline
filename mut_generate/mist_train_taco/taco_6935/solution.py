QUESTION:
Atul is frustrated with large digits factorials so he decided to convert the factorials in power of 10  ( 120 ->   1* 10^2 ). He is not good in programming so he is asking for your help to know the first digit of factorial and power of 10.  
For ex.  5 (120 ->   1* 10^2)   first digit = 1
                                               power     = 2
 
Example 1:
Ã¢â¬â¹Input : N = 5
Output : 1 0
Explanation:
Factorial of 5 = 120
So, first digit = 1 and power of 10 = 2
(1 * 10^{2})
Ã¢â¬â¹Example 2:
Input : N = 9
Output :  3 5 
 
Your Task:
This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function fact() that takes an integer N and return the first digit of factorial and power of 10. The driver code takes care of the printing.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).
 
Constraints
1 ≤ N≤ 2*10^{4}
