QUESTION:
There are 3N participants in AtCoder Group Contest. The strength of the i-th participant is represented by an integer a_i. They will form N teams, each consisting of three participants. No participant may belong to multiple teams.

The strength of a team is defined as the second largest strength among its members. For example, a team of participants of strength 1, 5, 2 has a strength 2, and a team of three participants of strength 3, 2, 3 has a strength 3.

Find the maximum possible sum of the strengths of N teams.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
* 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9}
* a_i are integers.
