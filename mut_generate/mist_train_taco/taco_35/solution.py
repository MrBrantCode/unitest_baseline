QUESTION:
We have n cards with each card numbered from 1 to n. All cards are randomly shuffled. We are allowed only operation moveCard(n) which moves the card with value n to the top of the pile. You are required to find out the minimum number of moveCard() operations required to sort the cards in increasing order.
 
Example 1:
Input:
n  = 5
a[] = {5, 1, 2, 3, 4}
Output:
4
Explanation:
5 1 2 3 4              //given sequence
4 5 1 2 3              //moveCard(4)
3 4 5 1 2              //moveCard(3)
2 3 4 5 1              //moveCard(2)
1 2 3 4 5              //moveCard(1)
Hence, minimum 4 operations are required.
 
Example 2:
Input:
n = 4
a[] = {3, 4, 2, 1}
Output:
2
Explanation:
3 4 2 1             //given sequence
2 3 4 1             //moveCard(2)
1 2 3 4             //moveCard(1)
Hence, minimum 2 operations are required.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function minOps() which takes the array a[] and its size n as inputs and returns the minimum number of operations required.
 
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
 
Constraints:
1 <= n <=10^{7} 
1 <= a[i] <= n
