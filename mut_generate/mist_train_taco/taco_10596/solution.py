QUESTION:
You are given two integers $n$ and $k$.

You should create an array of $n$ positive integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ such that the sum $(a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n)$ is divisible by $k$ and maximum element in $a$ is minimum possible.

What is the minimum possible maximum element in $a$?


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 10^9$; $1 \le k \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum possible maximum element in array $a$ such that the sum $(a_1 + \dots + a_n)$ is divisible by $k$.


-----Examples-----

Input
4
1 5
4 3
8 8
8 17
Output
5
2
1
3


-----Note-----

In the first test case $n = 1$, so the array consists of one element $a_1$ and if we make $a_1 = 5$ it will be divisible by $k = 5$ and the minimum possible.

In the second test case, we can create array $a = [1, 2, 1, 2]$. The sum is divisible by $k = 3$ and the maximum is equal to $2$.

In the third test case, we can create array $a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$. The sum is divisible by $k = 8$ and the maximum is equal to $1$.
