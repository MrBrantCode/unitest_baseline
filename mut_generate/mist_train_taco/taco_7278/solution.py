QUESTION:
Most programmers will tell you that one of the ways to improve your performance in competitive programming is to [practice a lot of problems].

Our Chef took the above advice very seriously and decided to set a target for himself.
Chef decides to solve at least 10 problems every week for 4 weeks. 

Given the number of problems he actually solved in each week over 4 weeks as P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, and P_{4}, output the number of weeks in which Chef met his target.

------ Input Format ------ 

There is a single line of input, with 4 integers P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, and P_{4}. These are the number of problems solved by Chef in each of the 4 weeks.

------ Output Format ------ 

Output a single integer in a single line - the number of weeks in which Chef solved at least 10 problems.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, P_{4} ≤ 100$

----- Sample Input 1 ------ 
12 15 8 10

----- Sample Output 1 ------ 
3

----- explanation 1 ------ 
Chef solved at least $10$ problems in the first, second and fourth weeks. He failed to solve at least $10$ problems in the third week. Hence, the number of weeks in which Chef met his target is $3$.

----- Sample Input 2 ------ 
2 3 1 10

----- Sample Output 2 ------ 
1

----- explanation 2 ------ 
Chef solved at least $10$ problems in the fourth week. He failed to solve at least $10$ problems in all the other three weeks. Hence, the number of weeks in which Chef met his target is $1$.

----- Sample Input 3 ------ 
12 100 99 11

----- Sample Output 3 ------ 
4

----- explanation 3 ------ 
Chef solved at least $10$ problems in all the four weeks. Hence, the number of weeks in which Chef met his target is $4$.

----- Sample Input 4 ------ 
1 1 1 1

----- Sample Output 4 ------ 
0

----- explanation 4 ------ 
Chef was not able to solve at least $10$ problems in any of the four weeks. Hence, the number of weeks in which Chef met his target is $0$.
