QUESTION:
God's Blessing on This PermutationForces!

A Random Pebble

You are given a permutation $p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n$ of length $n$ and a positive integer $k \le n$.

In one operation you can choose two indices $i$ and $j$ ($1 \le i < j \le n$) and swap $p_i$ with $p_j$.

Find the minimum number of operations needed to make the sum $p_1 + p_2 + \ldots + p_k$ as small as possible.

A permutation is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array) and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).


-----Input-----

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 100$).

The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n$ ($1 \le p_i \le n$). It is guaranteed that the given numbers form a permutation of length $n$.


-----Output-----

For each test case print one integer — the minimum number of operations needed to make the sum $p_1 + p_2 + \ldots + p_k$ as small as possible.


-----Examples-----

Input
4
3 1
2 3 1
3 3
1 2 3
4 2
3 4 1 2
1 1
1
Output
1
0
2
0


-----Note-----

In the first test case, the value of $p_1 + p_2 + \ldots + p_k$ is initially equal to $2$, but the smallest possible value is $1$. You can achieve it by swapping $p_1$ with $p_3$, resulting in the permutation $[1, 3, 2]$.

In the second test case, the sum is already as small as possible, so the answer is $0$.
