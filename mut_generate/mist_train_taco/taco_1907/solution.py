QUESTION:
You are given an unordered array of unique integers incrementing from $\mbox{1}$.  You can swap any two elements a limited number of times.  Determine the largest lexicographical value array that can be created by executing no more than the limited number of swaps.  

Example 

$arr=[1,2,3,4]$ 

$k=1$    

The following arrays can be formed by swapping the $\mbox{I}$ with the other elements: 

[2,1,3,4]
[3,2,1,4]
[4,2,3,1]

The highest value of the four (including the original) is $[4,2,3,1]$.  If $k\geq2$, we can swap to the highest possible value: $[4,3,2,1]$.

Function Description  

Complete the largestPermutation function in the editor below.  It must return an array that represents the highest value permutation that can be formed.  

largestPermutation has the following parameter(s):  

int k: the maximum number of swaps  
int arr[n]: an array of integers  

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $\boldsymbol{\mbox{k}}$, the length of $\textbf{arr}$ and the maximum swaps that can be performed.
The second line contains $n$ distinct space-separated integers from $\mbox{1}$ to $n$ as $arr\left[i\right]$ where $1\leq ar r[i]\leq n$.

Constraints

$1\leq n\leq10^5$ 

$1\leq k\leq10^9$  

Output Format

Print the lexicographically largest permutation you can make with at most $\boldsymbol{\mbox{k}}$ swaps. 

Sample Input 0  

STDIN       Function
-----       --------
5 1         n = 5, k = 1
4 2 3 5 1   arr = [4, 2, 3, 5, 1]

Sample Output 0  

5 2 3 4 1

Explanation 0  

You can swap any two numbers in $[4,2,3,5,1]$ and see the largest permutation is $[5,2,3,4,1]$

Sample Input 1

3 1
2 1 3

Sample Output 1  

3 1 2

Explanation 1  

With 1 swap we can get $[1,2,3]$, $[3,1,2]$ and $[2,3,1]$.  Of these, $[3,1,2]$ is the largest permutation.  

Sample Input 2

2 1
2 1

Sample Output 2  

2 1

Explanation 2  

We can see that $[2,1]$ is already the largest permutation.  We don't make any swaps.
