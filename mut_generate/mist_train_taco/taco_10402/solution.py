QUESTION:
Initially, the zoo have a single chick. A chick gives birth to 2 chicks every day and the life expectancy of a chick is 6 days. Zoo officials want to buy food for chicks so they want to know the number of chicks on an N^{th} day. Help the officials with this task.
 
Example 1:
Input: N = 2 
Output: 3
Explanation: First day there is only 1 chick.
On second day total number of chicks = 3. 
Example 2:
Input: N = 3
Output: 9
Explanation: First day there is only 1 chick.
On second day total number of chicks = 3.
On third day total number of chicks = 9
 
Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything, Your task is to complete the function NoOfChicks() which takes N as the input parameter and returns the total no. of chicks on the N^{th} day.
 
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Space Complexity: O(N)
 
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 35
