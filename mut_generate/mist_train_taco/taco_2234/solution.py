QUESTION:
We define subsequence as any subset of an array.  We define a subarray as a contiguous subsequence in an array.  

Given an array, find the maximum possible sum among:

all nonempty subarrays. 
all nonempty subsequences. 

Print the two values as space-separated integers on one line. 

Note that empty subarrays/subsequences should not be considered. 

Example 

$arr=[-1,2,3,-4,5,10]$   

The maximum subarray sum is comprised of elements at inidices $\left[1-5\right]$.  Their sum is $2+3+-4+5+10=16$.  The maximum subsequence sum is comprised of elements at indices $[1,2,4,5]$ and their sum is $2+3+5+10=20$.  

Function Description  

Complete the maxSubarray function in the editor below.    

maxSubarray has the following parameter(s):  

int arr[n]: an array of integers  

Returns  

int[2]: the maximum subarray and subsequence sums  

Input Format

The first line of input contains a single integer $\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{t}}$, the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$. 

The second line contains $n$ space-separated integers $arr\left[i\right]$ where $0\leq i<n$.   

Constraints

$1\leq t\leq10$
$1\leq n\leq10^5$   
$-10^4\leq arr[i]\leq10^4$   

The subarray and subsequences you consider should have at least one element.

Sample Input 0
2
4
1 2 3 4
6
2 -1 2 3 4 -5

Sample Output 0
10 10
10 11

Explanation 0

In the first case: The maximum sum for both types of subsequences is just the sum of all the elements since they are all positive.

In the second case: The subarray $[2,-1,2,3,4]$ is the subarray with the maximum sum, and $[2,2,3,4]$ is the subsequence with the maximum sum.

Sample Input 1
1
5
-2 -3 -1 -4 -6

Sample Output 1
-1 -1

Explanation 1

Since all of the numbers are negative, both the maximum subarray and maximum subsequence sums are made up of one element, $-1$.
