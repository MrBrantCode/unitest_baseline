QUESTION:
Given an array A[] of size N, find the longest subsequence such that difference between adjacent elements is one.
Example 1:
Input: N = 7
A[] = {10, 9, 4, 5, 4, 8, 6}
Output: 3
Explaination: The three possible subsequences 
{10, 9, 8} , {4, 5, 4} and {4, 5, 6}.
Example 2:
Input: N = 5
A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output: 5
Explaination: All the elements can be 
included in the subsequence.
Your Task:
You do not need to read input. Your task is to complete the function longestSubseq() which takes N and A[] as input parameters and returns the length of the longest such subsequence.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N^{2})
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{3}
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10^{3}
