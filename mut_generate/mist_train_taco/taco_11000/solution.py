QUESTION:
A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS ) if is meets any one of the following:
	It is an empty string "", or a single character not equals to " ( "  or  " ) " ,
	It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B ),
	where A and B are VPS's , or
	It can be written as (A) , where A is a VPS.
We can similarly define the nesting depth depth (S) of any VPS S as follows:
	depth ("") = 0
	depth (C) = 0, where C is a string with a single character excluding "(" and ")" ,
	depth (A + B) = max (depth (A) , depth (B)) , where A and B are VPS's.
	depth ( "(" + A + ")" ) = 1 + depth (A) , where A is a VPS.
For example , "" , " ( ) ( ) " , and " ( ) ( ( ) ( ) ) " and VPS's (with nesting depths 0 , 1, and 2), and " ) ( " and " ( ( ) "   are not VPS's.
Given a VPS represented as string S , return the nesting depth of S.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = " ((5+2)(3+4)((6))) "
Output: 3
Explanation: Character '6' is inside three nested parentheses.
 
Example 2:
Input: " (43+4++3)((3)(9))+1 "
Output: 2
Explanation: Character '3' and '9' both are inside two nested parentheses.
 
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function maxDepth() which takes the string s as input parameters and returns nesting depth of the given string s .
Expected Time Complexity: O(|s|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints:
1<=|s|<=100
s consists of digits 0-9 and characters ' + ' , ' - ' , ' * ' , ' / ' , ' ( ' , and ' ) '.
It is guaranteed that parentheses expression s is a VPS.
