QUESTION:
Given an array of numbers of size N. It is also given that the array elements are in range from 0 to N^{2} – 1. Sort the given array in linear time.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 7
arr[] = {40, 12, 45, 32, 33, 1, 22}
Output: 1 12 22 32 33 40 45
Explanation: Output is the sorted version of the
given array.
Ã¢â¬â¹Example 2:
Input: 
N = 5
arr[] = {24, 12, 0, 15, 8}
Output: 0 8 12 15 24
Explanation: Output is the sorted version of the
given array.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function sort () which takes an array arr[] and its size N as inputs and sorts the array in non-decreasing order. 
Note: You have to modify the input array such that it becomes sorted in non-decreasing order.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N). 
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^4
