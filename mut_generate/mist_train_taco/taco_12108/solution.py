QUESTION:
Lucas numbers are numbers in a sequence defined like this:
```
L(0) = 2
L(1) = 1
L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)
```

Your mission is to complete the function that returns the `n`th term of this sequence.

**Note:** It should work for negative numbers as well; how you do this is you flip the equation around, so for negative numbers: `L(n) = L(n+2) - L(n+1)`


## Examples
```
L(-10) = 123
L(-5)  = -11
L(-1)  =  -1
L(0)   =   2
L(1)   =   1
L(5)   =  11
L(10)  = 123
```

def lucas_number(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns the nth term of the Lucas sequence.

    The Lucas sequence is defined as:
    L(0) = 2
    L(1) = 1
    L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n >= 2
    For negative numbers, the sequence is defined as:
    L(n) = L(n+2) - L(n+1)

    Parameters:
    n (int): The position in the Lucas sequence.

    Returns:
    int: The nth term of the Lucas sequence.
