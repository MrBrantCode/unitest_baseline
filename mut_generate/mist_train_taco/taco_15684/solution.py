QUESTION:
Aditya has arranged some of his building blocks in N columns. Each column has a certain number of blocks given by an array A.
Each element of A(i.e. Ai) is the height of the ith column. Aditya now has M blocks left. He doesn't like small columns.
So he wants to maximize the minimum of all heights. He may or may not use all of the M blocks.
Determine the maximized height.
Example 1:
Ã¢â¬â¹Input : arr[ ] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and M = 6 
Output : 4
Explanation:
Final heights of blocks - 4 4 4 4 5
Ã¢â¬â¹Example 2:
Input : arr[ ] = {2, 8, 9} and M = 4 
Output :  6
Explanation:
Final heights of blocks - 6 8 9 
Your Task:
This is a function problem. The input is already taken care of by the driver code. You only need to complete the function maximised_height() that takes an array (arr), sizeOfArray (n), an integer M and return the maximized height. The driver code takes care of the printing.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N*LOG(N)).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
 
Output : 
For each test case, print the required answer in a new line.
Constraints :
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}
1 ≤ M ≤ 10^{4}
1 ≤ Ai ≤ 10^{4}
