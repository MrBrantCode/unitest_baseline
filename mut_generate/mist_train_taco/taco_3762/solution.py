QUESTION:
In Burger Town new burger restaurants will be opened! Concretely, $N$ restaurants will open in $N$ days, while restaurant $\boldsymbol{i}$ will be opened on day $\boldsymbol{i}$ and will be located at $X_i$. The town should be imagined as an one dimensional line in which every object's location can be described by the $\boldsymbol{x}$ coordinate.

Tim has just recently arrived the town after a very bad result in a programming contest. Thus he wants to cheer himself up by starting a trip to try out some new burgers. 

Every burger restaurant $\boldsymbol{i}$ is associated with two integers $A_i$ and $B_i$. If Tim eats a burger from $\boldsymbol{i}$, then his happiness will increase by $A_i$, which can also be negative, depending on the deliciousness of the burger. On the other hand, if Tim looks through the window of an opened restaurant $\boldsymbol{i}$, from which he will not eat a burger, then his happiness decreases by $B_i$, since Tim gets sad by only seeing the burgers. 

Tim's journey can start from any day $\boldsymbol{d}$ at the burger restaurant $\boldsymbol{d}$ and eats a burger from there. On each subsequent day $n>d$, Tim has the following options:

Stay at the previous restaurant $\boldsymbol{p}$. 
Or go to the new restaurant $n$ to eat a burger from there.

If he decides for the latter option, then on the path from $\boldsymbol{p}$ to $n$ he will look through all the windows that are on his path and maybe lose some happiness. Concretely, if $X_p<X_n$, then he will look through the window of every opened restaurant $\boldsymbol{i}$, having $X_p\leq X_i<X_n$. Similar for the case $X_n<X_p$.

Since Tim is a very good friend of yours you should help him finding a trip that will maximize his happiness. If he should stay at home since no trip would cheer him up, then print 0. 

Note: Tim's happiness is 0 at the beginning of the trip and is allowed to be negative throughout the time. 

Input Format

$N$ will be given on the first line, then $N$ lines will follow, describing the restaurants numbered from 1 to $N$ accordingly. Restaurant $\boldsymbol{i}$ will be described by $X_i$, $A_i$ and $B_i$ separated by a single space.

Output Format

Output the maximium happiness on one line.

Constraints  

$1\leq N\leq10^5$

$|A_i|\leq10^6$

$0\leq B_i\leq10^6$

$0\leq X_i\leq10^9$ and no two restaurants will have the same $\mbox{X}$ coordinates.

First testcase: His trip starts on day 2 at restaurant 2 located at $X_2=1$. He gains $A_2=5$ happiness points there by eating a burger. On the next day he goes from restaurant 2 to 3, but will look through the window of restaurant 2 and 1. Therefore he loses $B_2=1$ and $B_1=1$ points on the way to restaurant 3. There he eats a burger and gains another $A_3=5$ points. In total his happiness is equal to $5-1-1+5=$ 8 and this is optimal.

Second testcase: His trip starts on day 1 at restaurant 1. Then his actions on day 2, 3 and 4 will be go to restaurant 2, stay at restaurant 2 and go to restaurant 4 respectively. The happiness of this optimal trip is equal to $10-5+10=$ 15.

Third testcase: It's not worth to start the trip from any of the restaurant since he will only have negative happiness. That's why he should stay at home and 0 should be printed.
