QUESTION:
Alice thinks of a non-decreasing sequence of non-negative integers and wants Bob to guess it by providing him the set of all its K-sums with repetitions. 

What is this? Let the sequence be {A[1], A[2], ..., A[N]} and K be some positive integer that both Alice and Bob know. Alice gives Bob the set of all possible values that can be genereated by this - A[i_{1}] + A[i_{2}] + ... + A[i_{K}], where 1 ≤ i_{1} ≤ i_{2} ≤ ... ≤ i_{K} ≤ N. She can provide the values generated in any order she wishes to. Bob's task is to restore the initial sequence.

Consider an example. Let N = 3 and K = 2. The sequence is {A[1], A[2], A[3]}. The sequence of its 2-sums with repetitions is {A[1] + A[1], A[1] + A[2], A[1] + A[3], A[2] + A[2], A[2] + A[3], A[3] + A[3]}. But its elements could be provided in any order. For example any permutation of {2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6} corresponds to the sequence {1, 2, 3}.

Input Format

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. 

The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and K. 

The second line contains the sequence S_{i} of all K-sums with repetitions of the sequence Alice initially thought of.

Constraints

$1\leq T\leq10^5$  
$1\leq N\leq10^5$  
$1\leq K\leq10^9$  
$2\leq S_i\leq10^{18}$  

Note 

The total number of elements in any input sequence does not exceed 10^{5} 

Each element of each input sequence is non-negative integer not exceeding 10^{18}. 

Each input sequence is a correct sequence of all K-sums with repetitions of some non-decreasing sequence of non-negative integers.

Output Format

For each test case, output a single line containing the space separated list of elements of the non-decreasing sequence Alice thinks of. If there are several possible outputs you can output any of them.

2 2
12 34 56

2 3 4 4 5 6

Sample Output 0
1
6 28
1 2 3

Explanation 0

Sample case #00: When N = 1 and K = 3 the only K-sum is
S[1] = 3 * A[1]. Hence A[1] = S[1] / 3 = 3 / 3 = 1.

Sample case #01: Since 6 + 6 = 12, 6 + 28 = 34, 28 + 28 =
56, then Alice indeed could think of the sequence {6, 28}.

Sample case #02: It corresponds to the example in the problem
statement.
