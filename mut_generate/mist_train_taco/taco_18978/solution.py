QUESTION:
Aka Beko, trying to escape from 40 bandits, got lost in the city of A. Aka Beko wants to go to City B, where the new hideout is, but the map has been stolen by a bandit.

Kobborg, one of the thieves, sympathized with Aka Beko and felt sorry for him. So I secretly told Aka Beko, "I want to help you go to City B, but I want to give you direct directions because I have to keep out of my friends, but I can't tell you. I can answer. "

When Kobborg receives the question "How about the route XX?" From Aka Beko, he answers Yes if it is the route from City A to City B, otherwise. Check the directions according to the map below.

<image>


Each city is connected by a one-way street, and each road has a number 0 or 1. Aka Beko specifies directions by a sequence of numbers. For example, 0100 is the route from City A to City B via City X, Z, and W. If you choose a route that is not on the map, you will get lost in the desert and never reach City B. Aka Beko doesn't know the name of the city in which she is, so she just needs to reach City B when she finishes following the directions.

Kobborg secretly hired you to create a program to answer questions from Aka Beko. If you enter a question from Aka Beko, write a program that outputs Yes if it is the route from City A to City B, otherwise it outputs No.
