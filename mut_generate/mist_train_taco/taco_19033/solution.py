QUESTION:
Given an array of n positive integers. Find the sum of the maximum sum subsequence of the given array such that the integers in the subsequence are sorted in strictly increasing order i.e. a strictly increasing subsequence. 
Example 1:
Input: N = 5, arr[] = {1, 101, 2, 3, 100} 
Output: 106
Explanation:The maximum sum of a
increasing sequence is obtained from
{1, 2, 3, 100}
Example 2:
Input: N = 3, arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
Output: 6
Explanation:The maximum sum of a
increasing sequence is obtained from
{1, 2, 3}
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function maxSumIS() which takes N and array arr as input parameters and returns the maximum value.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N^{2})
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{3}
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^{5}
