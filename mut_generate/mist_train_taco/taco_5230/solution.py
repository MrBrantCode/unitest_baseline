QUESTION:
Let's call a positive integer $n$ ordinary if in the decimal notation all its digits are the same. For example, $1$, $2$ and $99$ are ordinary numbers, but $719$ and $2021$ are not ordinary numbers.

For a given number $n$, find the number of ordinary numbers among the numbers from $1$ to $n$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). Then $t$ test cases follow.

Each test case is characterized by one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

For each test case output the number of ordinary numbers among numbers from $1$ to $n$.


-----Examples-----

Input
6
1
2
3
4
5
100
Output
1
