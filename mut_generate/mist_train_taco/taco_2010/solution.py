QUESTION:
Ezio can manipulate at most X number of guards with the apple of eden.

Given that there are Y number of guards, predict if he can safely manipulate all of them.

------ Input Format ------ 

- First line will contain T, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers X and Y.

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case, print \texttt{YES} if it is possible for Ezio to manipulate all the guards. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO}.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings \texttt{YeS}, \texttt{yEs}, \texttt{yes} and \texttt{YES} will all be treated as identical).

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 100$
$1 ≤ X, Y ≤ 100$

----- Sample Input 1 ------ 
3
5 7
6 6
9 1
----- Sample Output 1 ------ 
NO
YES
YES
----- explanation 1 ------ 
Test Case $1$: Ezio can manipulate at most $5$ guards. Since there are $7$ guards, he cannot manipulate all of them.

Test Case $2$: Ezio can manipulate at most $6$ guards. Since there are $6$ guards, he can manipulate all of them.

Test Case $3$: Ezio can manipulate at most $9$ guards. Since there is only $1$ guard, he can manipulate the guard.
