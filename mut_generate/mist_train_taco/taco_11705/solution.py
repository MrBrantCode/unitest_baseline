QUESTION:
A tuple of positive integers (a, b, c) is said to be a *bad tuple* if a, b, c are distinct, a divides b, and b divides c. For example, (1, 2, 4) and (7, 21, 42) are bad tuples while (1, 2, 3) and (2, 4, 4) are not.

Chef has the N integers from 1 to N with him. He wants to pick a [subset] of these numbers such that it doesn't contain a *bad tuple*. How many distinct subsets can he pick?

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first and only line of input contains a single integer N, the number of available integers.

------ Output Format ------ 

Output the number of subsets that don't contain any bad tuples in them.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ N ≤ 60$

----- Sample Input 1 ------ 
2

----- Sample Output 1 ------ 
4

----- explanation 1 ------ 

----- Sample Input 2 ------ 
4

----- Sample Output 2 ------ 
14

----- explanation 2 ------ 
Test case $1$: There are $4$ subsets in total — $\{\}$, $\{1\}$, $\{2\}$, $\{1, 2\}$. None of these subsets violate the condition.

Test case $2$: There are $16$ subsets in total, out of which $2$ subsets — $\{1, 2, 4\}$ and $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ — violate the given condition as they contain the bad tuple $(1, 2, 4)$ in them.
