QUESTION:
Chef has opened a new airline. Chef has 10 airplanes where each airplane has a capacity of X passengers.  
On the first day itself, Y people are willing to book a seat in any one of Chef's airplanes. 

Given that Chef charges Z rupees for each ticket, find the maximum amount he can earn on the first day.

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of three space-separated integers X, Y, and Z — the capacity of each airplane, the number of people willing to book a seat in any one of Chef's airplanes on the first day, and the cost of each seat respectively.

------ Output Format ------ 

For each test case, output on a new line, the maximum amount Chef can earn on the first day.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 1000$
$1 ≤ X, Y, Z ≤ 100$

----- Sample Input 1 ------ 
4
2 15 10
1 10 1
5 60 100
1 11 7

----- Sample Output 1 ------ 
150
10
5000
70

----- explanation 1 ------ 
Test case $1$: Chef has $10$ airplanes and each airplane has a capacity of $2$ passengers. Thus, there are $20$ seats available in total.  
There are $15$ people who want to book a seat. Since we have enough seats for everyone, all $15$ people can book their seats and pay $10$ rupees each. The total money Chef earns is $15\cdot 10 = 150$.

Test case $2$: Chef has $10$ airplanes and each airplane has a capacity of $1$ passenger. Thus, there are $10$ seats available in total.  
There are $10$ people who want to book a seat. Since we have enough seats for everyone, all $10$ people can book their seats and pay $1$ rupee each. The total money Chef earns is $10\cdot 1 = 10$.

Test case $3$: Chef has $10$ airplanes and each airplane has a capacity of $5$ passengers. Thus, there are $50$ seats available in total.  
There are $60$ people who want to book a seat. Since we have only $50$ seats, only $50$ people can book their seats and pay $100$ rupees each. The total money Chef earns is $50\cdot 100 = 5000$.

Test case $4$: Chef has $10$ airplanes and each airplane has a capacity of $1$ passenger. Thus, there are $10$ seats available in total.  
There are $11$ people who want to book a seat. Since we have only $10$ seats, only $10$ people can book their seats and pay $7$ rupees each. The total money Chef earns is $10\cdot 7 = 70$.
