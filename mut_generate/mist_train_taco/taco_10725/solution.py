QUESTION:
In order to write a string, Atilla needs to first learn all letters that are contained in the string.

Atilla needs to write a message which can be represented as a string $s$. He asks you what is the minimum alphabet size required so that one can write this message.

The alphabet of size $x$ ($1 \leq x \leq 26$) contains only the first $x$ Latin letters. For example an alphabet of size $4$ contains only the characters ${a}$, ${b}$, ${c}$ and ${d}$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 1000$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 100$) — the length of the string.

The second line of each test case contains a string $s$ of length $n$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum alphabet size required to so that Atilla can write his message $s$.


-----Examples-----

Input
5
1
a
4
down
10
codeforces
3
bcf
5
zzzzz
Output
1
23
19
6
26


-----Note-----

For the first test case, Atilla needs to know only the character ${a}$, so the alphabet of size $1$ which only contains ${a}$ is enough.

For the second test case, Atilla needs to know the characters ${d}$, ${o}$, ${w}$, ${n}$. The smallest alphabet size that contains all of them is $23$ (such alphabet can be represented as the string ${abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw}$).
