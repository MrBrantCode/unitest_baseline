QUESTION:
Given two arrays A and B of size N, the task is to find the maximum sum possible of a window in array B such that elements of the same window in array A are unique.
Example 1:
Input: N = 7
A = [0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 4] 
B = [9, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
Output: 20
Explanation: The maximum sum possible 
in B[] such that all corresponding 
elements in A[] are unique is 
(9+8+1+2) = 20.
 
Example 2:
Input: N = 5
A = [0, 1, 2, 0, 2]
B = [5, 6, 7, 8, 2]
Output:  21
Ã¢â¬â¹Your Task:
This is a function problem. You don't need to take any input, as it is already accomplished by the driver code. You just need to complete the function returnMaxSum() that takes array A, array B, and integer N as parameters and returns the maximum possible sum.
 
Expected Time Complexity: O(N). 
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).
 
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}
