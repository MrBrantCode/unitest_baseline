QUESTION:
Consider a game where a player can score 3 or 5 or 10 points in a move. Given a total score n, find number of distinct combinations to reach the given score.
Example:
Input
3
8
20
13
Output
1
4
2
Explanation
For 1st example when n = 8
{ 3, 5 } and {5, 3} are the 
two possible permutations but 
these represent the same 
cobmination. Hence output is 1.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function count( ) which takes N as input parameter and returns the answer to the problem.
Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
