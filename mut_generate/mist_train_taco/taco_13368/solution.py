QUESTION:
Problem

The popular video posting site "ZouTube" is now in the midst of an unprecedented "virtual ZouTuber" boom. Among them, the one that has been attracting particular attention recently is the junior virtual ZouTuber "Aizumarim (commonly known as Azurim)".

As a big fan of Azlim, you're going to send her a "special chat" on Azlim's live stream today.

"Special chat" is a "function that viewers give points to distributors" provided by ZouTube. Viewers can spend $ 500 $, $ 1000 $, $ 5000 $, or $ 10000 $ for each $ 1 special chat, and give the distributor the same amount of points as they spend.

Given the total amount of points you have now, spend those points to find the maximum total amount of points you can give to Azlim. You can have as many special chats as you like, as long as the amount of points you hold is not less than the amount of points you consume.

Constraints

The input satisfies the following conditions.

* $ 1 \ le P \ le 10 ^ 5 $

Input

The input is given in the following format.


$ P $


An integer $ P $ representing the total amount of points you have now is given in the $ 1 $ line.
