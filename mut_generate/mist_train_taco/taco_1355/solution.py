QUESTION:
Given a tree of N nodes, where each node is uniquely numbered in between [1, N]. Each node also has a value which is initially 0. You need to perform following two operations in the tree.  

Update Operation
Report Operation

Update Operation

U r t a b

Adds $a^{b}$ + $(a+1)^{b} $+ $(b+1)^{a} $to all nodes in the subtree rooted at t, considering that tree is rooted at r (see explanation for more details).  

Report Operation

R r t m

Output the sum of all nodes in the subtree rooted at t, considering that tree is rooted at r. Output the sum modulo m (see explanation for more details).

Input Format

First line contains N, number of nodes in the tree. 

Next N-1 lines contain two space separated integers x and y which denote that there is an edge between node x and node y. 

Next line contains Q, number of queries to follow. 

Next Q lines follow, each line will be either a report operation or an update operation.  

Output Format

For each report query output the answer in a separate line.

Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 100000 

1 ≤ Q ≤ 100000 

1 ≤ m ≤ 101 

1 ≤ r, t, x, y ≤ N 

x ≠ y 

1 ≤ a, b ≤ $10^{18}  $

Notes

There will be at most one edge between a pair of nodes.
There will be no loop.
Tree will be completely connected. 

Sample Input

4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4
U 3 2 2 2
U 2 3 2 2
R 1 2 8
R 4 3 9

Sample Output

2
3

Explanation

Initially Values in each node : [0,0,0,0] 

The first query is U 3 2 2 2. Here, tree is rooted at 3. It looks like 

    3(0)
   / \
  /   \
 2(0)  4(0)
 |
 |
 1(0)

For the sub tree rooted at 2 ( nodes 2 and 1 ), we add $a^{b}$  +$ (a+1)^{b}$ + $(b+1)^{a}$ =$ 2^{2}$ + $3^{2}$ + $3^{2}$ = 22. After first update operation, nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 will have values 22, 22, 0 and 0 respectively.  

    3(0)
   / \
  /   \
 2(22) 4(0)
 |
 |
 1(22)

The second query is U 2 3 2 2. Here, tree is rooted at 2. It looks like

    2(22)
   / \
  /   \
 1(22) 3(0)
       |
       |
       4(0)

For the sub tree rooted at 3 (nodes 3 and 4), we add $a^{b}$ + $(a+1)^{b}$ + $(b+1)^{a}$ = $2^{2}$ + $3^{2}$ + $3^{2} $= 22. After second update operation, nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 each have values 22,22,22,22 respectively.  

    2(22)
   / \
  /   \
 1(22) 3(22)
       |
       |
       4(22)

The first report query is R 1 2 8 asks for the sum modulo 8 of the subtree rooted at 2, when the tree is rooted at 1. The tree looks like 

1(22)
 \
  \
   2*(22)
   |
   |
   3*(22)
   |
   |
   4*(22)

The sum of the values of nodes 2, 3 and 4 are 

(22 + 22 + 22) % 8 = 2

The second report query is R 4 3 9 asks for the sum modulo 9 of the subtree rooted at 3 when the tree is rooted at 4. The tree looks like 

4(22)
 \
  \
   3*(22)
   |
   |
   2*(22)
   |
   |
   1*(22)

The sum of the values of nodes 3, 2 and 1 are 

(22 + 22 + 22) % 9 = 3

Time Limits: 

C, C++: 4s | Java and other JVM based languages: 10s | Python, Python3 = 45s | Other interpreted Language: 30s | C#, Haskell: 10s | Rest: 3 times of default.
