QUESTION:
A person wants to go from origin to a particular location, he can move in only 4 directions(i.e East, West, North, South) but his friend gave him a long route, help a person to find minimum Moves so that he can reach to the destination.
Note: You need to print the lexicographically sorted string. Assume the string will have only ‘E’ ‘N’ ‘S’ ‘W’ characters.
Example 1:
Input:
S = "SSSNEEEW"
Output: EESS
Explanation: Following the path SSSNEEEW
and EESS gets you at the same final point.
There's no shorter path possible.
Ã¢â¬â¹Example 2:
Input: 
S = "NESNWES"
Output: E
Explanation: Following the path NESNWES
and E gets you at the same final point.
There's no shorter path possible.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function shortestPath() which takes the string S as input and returns the resultant string denoting the shortest path in lexicographic order.
Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|) for output.
Constraints:
1<=|S|<=10^{5}
