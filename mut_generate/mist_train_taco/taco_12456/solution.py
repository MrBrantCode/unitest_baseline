QUESTION:
Given a number N. The task is to generate and print all binary numbers with decimal values from 1 to N.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 2
Output: 
1 10
Explanation: 
Binary numbers from
1 to 2 are 1 and 10.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 5
Output: 
1 10 11 100 101
Explanation: 
Binary numbers from
1 to 5 are 1 , 10 , 11 , 100 and 101.
 
Your Task:
You only need to complete the function generate() that takes N as parameter and returns vector of strings denoting binary numbers.
Expected Time Complexity : O(N log_{2}N)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(N log_{2}N)
Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^{6}
