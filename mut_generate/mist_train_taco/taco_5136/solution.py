QUESTION:
$\textit{Knight L}$ is a chess piece that moves in an L shape. We define the possible moves of $\textit{Knight L}(a,b)$ as any movement from some position $(x_{1},y_{1})$ to some $(x_2,y_2)$ satisfying either of the following:

$x_2=x_1\pm a$ and $y_2=y_1\pm b$, or  
$x_2=x_1\pm b$ and $y_2=y_1\pm a$  

Note that $(a,b)$ and $(b,a)$ allow for the same exact set of movements. For example, the diagram below depicts the possible locations that $\textit{Knight L}(1,2)$ or $\textit{Knight L}(2,1)$ can move to from its current location at the center of a $5\times5$ chessboard:

Observe that for each possible movement, the Knight moves $2$ units in one direction (i.e., horizontal or vertical) and $\mbox{1}$ unit in the perpendicular direction.

Given the value of $n$ for an $n\times n$ chessboard, answer the following question for each $(a,b)$ pair where $1\leq a,b<n$:

What is the minimum number of moves it takes for $\textit{Knight L}(a,b)$ to get from position $(0,0)$ to position $(n-1,n-1)$? If it's not possible for the Knight to reach that destination, the answer is -1 instead.

Then print the answer for each $\textit{Knight L}(a,b)$ according to the Output Format specified below.

Input Format

A single integer denoting $n$.

Constraints

$5\leq n\leq25$

Output Format

Print exactly $n-1$ lines of output in which each line $\boldsymbol{i}$ (where $1\leq i\lt n$) contains $n-1$ space-separated integers describing the minimum number of moves $\textit{Knight L}(i,j)$ must make for each respective $j$ (where $1\leq j\lt n$). If some $\textit{Knight L}(i,j)$ cannot reach position $(n-1,n-1)$, print -1 instead.  

For example, if $n=3$, we organize the answers for all the $(i,j)$ pairs in our output like this:

(1,1) (1,2)
(2,1) (2,2)

Sample Input 0
5

Sample Output 0
4 4 2 8
4 2 4 4
2 4 -1 -1
8 4 -1 1

Explanation 0

The diagram below depicts possible minimal paths for $\textit{Knight L}(1,1)$, $\textit{Knight L}(1,2)$, and $\textit{Knight L}(1,3)$:

One minimal path for $\textit{Knight}L(1,4)$ is: $(0,0)\to(1,4)\to(2,0)\to(3,4)\to(4,0)\to(0,1)\to(4,2)\to(0,3)\to(4,4)$

We then print 4 4 2 8 as our first line of output because $\textit{Knight L}(1,1)$ took $\begin{array}{c}A\end{array}$ moves, $\textit{Knight L}(1,2)$ took $\begin{array}{c}A\end{array}$ moves, $\textit{Knight L}(1,3)$ took $2$ moves, and $\textit{Knight}L(1,4)$ took $8$ moves. 

In some of the later rows of output, it's impossible for $\textit{Knight L}(i,j)$ to reach position $(4,4)$. For example, $\textit{Knight L}(3,3)$ can only move back and forth between $(0,0)$ and $(3,3)$ so it will never reach $(4,4)$.
