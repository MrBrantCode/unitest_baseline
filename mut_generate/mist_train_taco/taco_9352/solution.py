QUESTION:
Tonight, in your favourite cinema they are giving the movie Joker and all seats are occupied. In the cinema there are N rows with N seats each, forming an N\times N square. We denote with 1, 2,\dots, N the viewers in the first row (from left to right); with N+1, \dots, 2N the viewers in the second row (from left to right); and so on until the last row, whose viewers are denoted by N^2-N+1,\dots, N^2.

At the end of the movie, the viewers go out of the cinema in a certain order: the i-th viewer leaving her seat is the one denoted by the number P_i. The viewer P_{i+1} waits until viewer P_i has left the cinema before leaving her seat. To exit from the cinema, a viewer must move from seat to seat until she exits the square of seats (any side of the square is a valid exit). A viewer can move from a seat to one of its 4 adjacent seats (same row or same column). While leaving the cinema, it might be that a certain viewer x goes through a seat currently occupied by viewer y; in that case viewer y will hate viewer x forever. Each viewer chooses the way that minimizes the number of viewers that will hate her forever.

Compute the number of pairs of viewers (x, y) such that y will hate x forever.

Constraints

* 2 \le N \le 500
* The sequence P_1, P_2, \dots, P_{N^2} is a permutation of \\{1, 2, \dots, N^2\\}.
