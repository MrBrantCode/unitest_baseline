QUESTION:
Given an array arr of size N and two integers l and r, the task is to sort the given array in non - decreasing order in the index range from l to r.
Example 1: 
Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 2}
l = 2, r = 3
Output: {1, 5, 2, 3}
Explanation: After sorting array
will look like {1, 5, 2, 3} 
Ã¢â¬â¹Example 2: 
Input: 
N = 3
arr[] = {2, 3, 4}
l = 0, r = 2
Output: {2, 3, 4}
Explanation: Array is already sorted
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function partSort() which takes the array arr[], N, l and r as inputs and sorts the given the array in given range.
Expected Time Complexity: O(NlogN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Constraints :
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ l, r ≤ N-1

    Sorts the given array arr in non-decreasing order in the index range from l to r.

    Parameters:
    arr (list): The input array.
    l (int): The starting index of the range to be sorted.
    r (int): The ending index of the range to be sorted.

    Returns:
    list: The modified array after sorting the specified range.
