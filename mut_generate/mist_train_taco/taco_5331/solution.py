QUESTION:
Consider a matrix where each cell contains either a $0$ or a $1$.  Any cell containing a $1$ is called a filled cell. Two cells are said to be connected if they are adjacent to each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  In the following grid, all cells marked X are connected to the cell marked Y.

XXX
XYX  
XXX    

If one or more filled cells are also connected, they form a region. Note that each cell in a region is connected to zero or more cells in the region but is not necessarily directly connected to all the other cells in the region.

Given an $n\times m$ matrix, find and print the number of cells in the largest region in the matrix. Note that there may be more than one region in the matrix.

For example, there are two regions in the following $3\times3$ matrix.  The larger region at the top left contains $3$ cells.  The smaller one at the bottom right contains $1$.

Function Description  

Complete the connectedCell function in the editor below.  

connectedCell has the following parameter(s): 

- int matrix[n][m]: $matrix[i]$ represents the $i^{\mbox{th}}$ row of the matrix  

Returns 

- int: the area of the largest region  

Input Format

The first line contains an integer $n$, the number of rows in the matrix. 

The second line contains an integer $m$, the number of columns in the matrix. 

Each of the next $n$ lines contains $m$ space-separated integers $matrix[i][j]$.

Constraints

$0<n,m<10$

Explanation

The diagram below depicts two regions of the matrix.  Connected regions are filled with X or Y.  Zeros are replaced with dots for clarity.  

X X . .
. X X .
