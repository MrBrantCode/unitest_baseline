QUESTION:
There are total n tasks given to a group of 5 students in a class. Three of those five students completed m tasks of their choices and left the group. Now the burden of completing remaining tasks is on the two students Tanya and Manya. Suppose the n tasks are in an array form 1,2,3,...n. Tanya and Manya decided to complete their remaining tasks in the following manner :- First of the remaining task is done by Tanya and the next remaining one by Manya . For example if n = 10 and m = 4 and the completed 4 tasks are {2, 3, 5, 7} then the reamining tasks are {1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10} so, Tanya completes {1, 6, 9} tasks and Manya completes {4, 8, 10} tasks and thereby completing the n tasks given.
Given n, m and the indexes (1 for first task, 2 for second task and so on..) of completed tasks, find the tasks which Tanya and Manya have to complete.
Example 1:
Input:
n = 15, m = 6
arr[] = {2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 4}
Output: 
1 8 11 13 15 
3 10 12 14 
Explanation: The remaining tasks are :
{1, 3, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}.
So Tanya should take these tasks :
{1, 8, 11, 13, 15}.
And Manya should take these tasks :
{3, 10, 12, 14}.
Example 2:
Input:
n = 4, m = 3
arr[] = {2, 4, 3}
Output: 
1
Explanation: There are no task for Manya.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findTasks() which takes the array of integers arr, m and n as parameters and returns a pair of an array of integers denoting the answer.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)
Constraints:
1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 10^{5}
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n
