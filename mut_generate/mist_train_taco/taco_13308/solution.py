QUESTION:
You are a student of University of Aizu. And you work part-time at a restaurant.

Staffs of the restaurant are well trained to be delighted to provide more delicious products faster.

The speed providing products particularly depends on skill of the staff. So, the manager of the restaurant want to know how long it takes to provide products.

Though some restaurants employ a system which calculates how long it takes to provide products automatically, the restaurant where you work employs a system which calculates it manually.

You, a student of University of Aizu, want to write a program to calculate it, and you hope that your program makes the task easier. You are given the checks in a day. If the length of time it takes to provide the products of a check is shorter than or equal to 8 minutes, it is "ok" check. Write a program to output the ratio of "ok" checks to the total in percentage.

Hint

If you want to read three integers in the following format,
integer:integer(space)integer
you can read them by scanf("%d%*c%d%d",&a;, &b;, &c;); in C.



Input

The input consists of multiple datasets. The last dataset is followed by a line containing a single zero. You don't have to process this data. The first line of each dataset contains a single integer n.

n (0 < n  ≤ 100) is the number of checks. Each of following  n  lines gives the details of a check in the following format.


hh:mm MM


hh:mm is the clock time to print the check. MM is minute of the clock time to provide products. The clock time is expressed according to the 24 hour clock.
For example, "eleven one PM" is expressed by "23:01".
You can assume that the all of products are provided within fifteen minutes. The restaurant is open from AM 11:00 to AM 02:00. After AM 02:00, no check is printed. Also at AM 02:00, no check is printed.

Output

Your program has to print in the following format for each dataset.


lunch L
dinner D
midnight M


L  is ratio of "ok" check printed to the total in lunch time.  D  is ratio of "ok" check printed to the total in dinner time.  M  is ratio of "ok" check printed to the total in midnight time. You can truncate digits number after the decimal point of the ratio on the percentage. Lunch, dinner, and midnight times are defined as follows:


Lunch time is 11:00 ~ 14:59.
Dinner time is 18:00 ~ 20:59.
Midnight time is 21:00 ~ 01:59.


If a check is not printed in the three range of time, you don't have to process it. If no check is in the range of time, you should print "no guest".

Example

Input

5
12:57 59
20:12 15
12:19 21
18:52 03
16:09 14
0


Output

lunch 100
dinner 50
midnight no guest
