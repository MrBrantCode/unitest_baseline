QUESTION:
A circular array of length N is defined as follows: N integers A_{1},A_{2},…,A_{N} are placed in a circle in such a way that for each 1 ≤ i < N, A_{i} and A_{i+1} are adjacent, and A_{1} and A_{N} are also adjacent.

You are given a circular array A of length N. At the end of each second, the following changes are executed in the array: If A_{i} > 0 then the elements which are adjacent to A_{i}, will get incremented by 1, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ N.

For example, consider the array A = [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5]. 
Initially A_{4} and A_{8} are greater than zero. So after one second, A_{3}, A_{5}, A_{1} and A_{7} will get incremented by 1. Hence the array will become A = [1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 5].

After two seconds, the array becomes A = [2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 7]. Note that the value of A_{4} has become 4, because both, A_{3} and A_{5} were greater than zero after one second.

What will be the sum of elements present in the array A after K seconds?

------ Input Format ------ 

- The first line will contain T, number of testcases. Then T testcases follow.
- The first line of each testcase contains 2 space separated integers N and K.
- The second line of each testcase line contains N integers A_{1}, A_{2}, \dots, A_{N}. 

------ Output Format ------ 

For each testcase, output in a single line containing the sum of the all the elements present in the array A after K seconds.

------ Constraints ------ 

$1 ≤ T ≤ 10^{4}$
$3 ≤ N ≤ 10^{5}$
$0 ≤ A_{i} ≤ 10^{6}$
$0 ≤ K ≤ 10^{9}$
- Sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^{6}$.

Test Case 1: After one second, the array will become $A = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0]$. So the sum of elements present in the array is = $1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 6$.

Test Case 2: No change will be executed in the array as $K = 0$. So the required sum will be equal to 3.
